LOS ANGELES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT – DAY\\nWe hear the rhythm of funky seventies SOUL MUSIC .\\nThen SHE steps into FRAME .\\nShe is JACKIE BROWN , a stewardess dressed in her CABO AIR  uniform. (A little shuttle\\nairline that flies from Los Angeles to Cabo San Lucas. Approximate flight time: forty five\\nminutes)\\nJackie stands still as a people-mover slowly inches her through the airport. The CREDITS\\nAPEAR  and DISAPPEAR  in front of her.\\nJackie Brown is a very attractive black woman in her mid forties, though she looks like she\\'s in\\nher mid-thirties.\\nThe people-mover reaches the end of the line, she steps off.\\nShe breezes through Customs and we follow her with a STEDICAM  as she strides through the\\nairport... She gets to her gate disappears inside the plane for a moment comes back out sans\\nflight bag picks up the microphone.\\nJACKIE\\n(into mike)\\nFlight 710 Cabo San Lucas, now boarding Gate 12, first\\nclass only.\\nWith a smile on her face, she collects passengers\\' boarding passes as they board the plane.\\nFADE TO BLACK\\nTITLE CARD\\n\"ORDELL ROBBIE\"\\nFADE UP ON:\\nEXT. FIRING RANGE – DAY\\nVIDEO\\nA chorus line of six beautiful bikini-clad women, all holding different automatic weapons,\\nBLASTING  away.\\nThe cheap VIDEO TITLES  to:\\n\"CHICKS WHO LOVE GUNS\"\\nPlay over this image.\\nOne bikini beauty is singled out. She\\'s a gorgeous brunette named SIDNEY . Sidney stands\\nfacing camera holding a TEC-9 and describing it.}\\nSIDNEY\\n(to camera)\\nHi, I\\'m Sidney. And I love to TEC-9. The popular TEC-9 is\\nadvertised by its makers as being tough as the toughest\\ncustomer.\\nSIDNEY\\'S STATISTICS:  Age, height, measurements, date of birth, appear at the bottom left-\\nhand corner. As Sidney continues her sales pitch/demonstration, a BLACK MAN\\'S VOICE\\nbegins talking over the video.\\nBLACK MAN (O.S.)\\nThat\\'s a TEC-9. It\\'s a cheap ass spray gun outta South\\nMiami.\\nAfter a CLOSEUP  of the TEC-9, Sidney FIRES the weapon.\\nBLACK VOICE (O.S.) (CONT\\'D)\\nCost three-eighty retail. I get them for two hundred and sell\\n\\'em for eight.\\nINT. MELANIE\\'S BEAHC APARTMENT – NIGHT\\nThe Black Voice belong to forty-five-year old ORDELL ROBBIE .\\nOrdell wears clothes nice and likes wearing nice clothes. Stylish, athletic wear (Reebok), heavy,\\nblack leather jackets (Hugo Boss), warm-colored berets and baseball caps to cover his balding\\nhead are Ordell\\'s \"look.\" At this moment Ordell\\'s wearing an open silk shirt.\\nOrdell narrates the video playing on the big-screen V. (the most expensive thing in the\\napartment). He holds a cocktail in one hand (screwdriver, his drink of choice) and the remote\\ncontrol in the other, pacing the floor in his I-can-talk-anybody-into-anything voice.\\nLOUIS GARA , who looks like he does his shopping at the Salvation Army (dressed in a\\nHawaiian shirt and dungarees), sits on the sofa staring blankly at the video, drinking Jack\\nDaniels on ice. Louis, white, also in his mid forties, has lived over half of his life in penal\\ninstitutions. The experience has affected both his body language and his thought process.\\nWhile acutely aware of the rhythm of life inside a correction facility, in the real world his timing\\nis thrown. It\\'s like a song he doesn\\'t know the lyrics to but attempt to sing anyway.\\nThe third person watching the video is the person who lives in this apartment, MELANIE\\nRALSTON . Melanie, thirty-three, is a tanned, blonde, California beach bunny. Like the kind\\nyou se in the old Crown International movies from the seventies like \"Pom Pom Girls\" \"Malibu\\nBeach\" and \"Beach Girls,\" except Melanie is older than any of those girls ever are. She\\'s\\ndressed in her Melanie-uniform of stringy Levis cutoffs and a stringy bra top. So far Melanie\\nhas been able to make a living out of lying in the sun, always finding a generous, wealthy man\\nmore than willing to pay her rent and pick up her tabs. In her prime (twenty two) it was\\nJapanese industrialists, film production guys, and Middle Eastern businessmen who kept\\nMelanie. And it was places like the Bahamas, Acapulco, and the Virgin Islands where they kept\\nher.\\nBut now, at thirty three, she lives in an apartment in Hermosa Beach, California that Ordell\\npays for an drops in and out of. She\\'s curled up in a reclining chair, smoking weed from a pipe,\\nreading Movieline Magazine and paying no attention to the video.}\\nORDELL\\nThis TEC-9? They advertise it as being the most popular\\ngun in American crime. Can you believe that shit? It\\nactually says that on the little booklet that comes with it.\\n\"Most Popular Gun in American Crime,\" like they\\'re\\nproud of that shit.\\nOrdell hits the fast-forward on his remote control.\\nSidney is rushed off the screen and replace by CINDY , a pretty, blonde bodybuilder clad in a\\nred, white and blue bikini, holding a Styer Aug.\\nORDELL (CONT\\'D)\\nCheck out this body-builder chick... Now see what she got.\\nThat\\'s a Styer aug. Styer Aug\\'s a bad motherfucker. Listen.\\nOrdell punches up the volume.\\nCindy BLASTS  the Styer Aug, loud.\\nOrdell imitates the sound of the weapon.\\nORDELL (CONT\\'D)\\nShit\\'s expensive, man. Comes from Austria. My customers\\ndon\\'t know shit about it, so there ain\\'t no demand.\\n(to Melanie)\\nBaby, I could use some more ice.\\nMelanie puts down the magazine, takes his cocktail glass from him and moves to the kitchen.\\nORDELL (CONT\\'D)\\nBut put that bad boy in a flick, every motherfucker out\\nthere want one. I\\'m serious as a heart attack. Them Hong\\nKong movies came out, every nigga gotta have a forty-five.\\nAnd they don\\'t want one, they want two, cause nigga want\\nto be \"The Killer.\" What they don\\'t know, and that movie\\ndon\\'t tell you is a .45 has a serious fuckin\\' jammin\\'\\nproblem.

Do I have a choice?\\nDARGUS\\nYou have the right to say \"no.\" And I have the right to\\nmake you wait here with Ray while I go get a warrant.

You see,\\nlike you, Beaumont found himself in some hot water. He\\nwas looking at ten years he was pretty sure he didn\\'t want\\nto do and was understandably concerned.

Victims, witnesses, innocent\\nbystanders... You ain\\'t any of these. Then there\\'s two;\\nCRIMINALS. These sonabitches have dedicated their lives\\nto a life outside the law. That ain\\'t you either. Where you\\nbelong is the third category. The category we refer to as\\nLOSERS.\\nJackie\\'s eyes don\\'t even narrow at the insult. She just says without expression;\\nJACKIE\\nI\\'m not a loser.\\nDARGUS\\nOh, you\\'re both? In 1985 you were flying for TWA and got\\nbusted for carrying drugs. You were carrying them for a\\npilot husband of yours. He did time and you got off. But\\nthat ended your career with the big airlines. Cut to thirteen\\nyears later. You\\'re forty-four years of age. You\\'re flying for\\nthe shittiest little shuttle-fucking piece of shit Mexican\\nairline that there is. Where you make a whopping twelve-\\nthousand dollars a year. That ain\\'t a hulluva lot to show for\\na twenty year career. And to top it off, you\\'re going to jail.\\nNow true, the judge, even with your prior, will probably\\nonly give you a year or two. But this doesn\\'t seem like the\\ntime of life you got years to throw away.\\n(MORE)}\\nDARGUS (CONT‘D)\\n(pause)\\nNow, we don\\'t like trying losers like they\\'re criminals. But\\nin the absence of a criminal, we will try you.

So we\\'ll know\\nexactly how much money we\\'re talkin\\' about here.\\nJackie gets up from her chair, walks over to the desk, unzips the bag, takes out the manila\\nenvelope and drops it on the desk.\\nJACKIE\\nHelp yourself.\\nDARGUS\\nWhile you\\'re at it, let me see what else is in there. You\\nmind?\\nShe reaches in the bag and brings out a pocketbook.\\nJACKIE\\nMy pocketbook.\\nDARGUS\\nWhat\\'s in it?\\nJACKIE\\nBeauty products.\\nNicolet takes the manila envelope.\\nNICOLET\\nI\\'ll count the money.\\nDargus points at a clear plastic bag with pills and packets in it.\\nDARGUS\\nWhat\\'s this?}\\nJACKIE\\nThat\\'s my diet shit.\\nNicolet takes out the bills from the envelope.\\nDARGUS\\nLet\\'s see what else is in there.\\nNicolet takes the bills and looks inside the envelope. His expression changes to a shit-eating\\ngrin.\\nNICOLET\\nOh, Miss Brown?\\nJACKIE\\nYeah?\\nNicolet pulls out a clear cellophane sandwich bag with a half-inch or so of white powder inside.\\nNICOLET\\nAnd what would this be, Sweet and Low?\\nJACKIE\\nWhat the fuck is that shit?\\nNICOLET\\nI know what it looks like.\\nJACKIE\\nYou planted that shit on me.\\nNicolet and Dargus laugh at that.\\nJACKIE\\nLook, that shit ain\\'t mine.\\nNICOLET\\n(to Dargus)\\nIt isn\\'t enough for Trafficking, but how \\'bout Posession\\nwith the Intent to Distribute?\\nDARGUS\\nOh, I wouldn\\'t be so sure. What with all the cash, I think I\\ncould go with Conspiracy to Traffic.\\nJACKIE\\nI\\'m tellin\\' you, I don\\'t know nothin\\' about that fuckin\\' shit.\\nNICOLET\\nWell then, Miss Brown.

Then their asses lucked out and found\\nthat coke.\\nMAX\\nWhat did they want to know?\\nJACKIE\\nWho gave me the money and who I was giving it to. And\\nsome guy they found in a trunk with his head blown off.\\nSaid it was him who told them \\'bout me.\\nThe Waitress comes with the drinks.\\nROWEN\\nCan I get you two some popcorn?\\nMAX\\nNo, thanks.\\nRowen exits.\\nMAX (CONT\\'D)\\nThat would be Beaumont Livingston.\\nJACKIE\\nThat\\'s him. How do you know \\'em?\\nMAX\\nI wrote him on Monday. They found him dead on Tuesday.\\nJACKIE\\nOrdell pick up his bond?\\nMAX\\nSame as you. Ten thousand.\\nJACKIE\\nThe federal agent kinda half hinted Ordell might of done\\nBeaumont.\\nMAX\\nYou mentioned a guy from L.A.P.D., but you didn\\'t\\nmention the Federal.}\\nJACKIE\\nI didn\\'t?\\nMAX\\nNo, you didn\\'t. What branch?\\nJACKIE\\nRay Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.\\nMax puts it together.\\nMAX\\nHe\\'s the one who wants you.\\nJACKIE\\nIt was the other guy who busted me.\\nMAX\\n\\'Cause if he busted you, you\\'d play hell bonding out of\\nfederal court. He doesn\\'t want you mad at him, he wants\\nyou to tell him what you know. He uses you to get a line on\\nOrdell, make a case, then take him federal. You know what\\nOrdell\\'s into?\\nJACKIE\\nI have a pretty good idea. Ordell aint no bootlegger and I\\ndoubt he\\'s smugglin\\' Cuban cigars. So that only leaves one\\nthing an A.T.F. man would be interested in.\\nJackie waits a moment before answering, weighs things in her mind and makes a decision.\\nJACKIE\\nI used to bring over ten thousand at a time. That\\'s the legal\\nlimit, so I never brought more than that.\\nMAX\\nHow many trips did you make?\\nJACKIE\\nWith ten thousand? Nine.\\nMAX\\nHe\\'s got that kinda money?\\nJACKIE\\nIt\\'s all in lock boxes in a Mexico bank. But he\\'s got a\\nproblem. He\\'s – what do you call it when you got money,\\nbut don\\'t have cash?\\nMAX\\nCash poor?\\nJACKIE\\nThat\\'s it. He\\'s cash poor. He kept on me till I finally said\\nokay. I\\'ll bring whatever fits in a nine-by-twelve envelope. I\\ngot paid five hundred dollars, and his friend, Mr. Walker,\\nin Mexico gave me the envelope.}\\nMAX\\nIf you knew bringing anything over ten thousand was\\nagainst the law, why not pack a hundred grand?\\nJackie gets exasperated.\\nJACKIE\\nWhatever it was had to fit in my bag and not hit you in the\\nface if the bag was opened. This ain\\'t solvin\\' my problem. I\\ngotta figure out a way to either keep my job or get out of\\ntrouble. I\\'m of today, but if I can\\'t leave the country I\\'m\\nout of a job. And if I don\\'t got a job, I can\\'t hire a lawyer.\\nMAX\\nAsk A.T.F. They might give you permission.\\nJACKIE\\nYeah, if I cooperate.\\nMAX\\nWell, Jackie, you got caught, you\\'re gonna have to give \\'em\\nsomething.\\nJACKIE\\nBut if all I can give \\'em is Ordell\\'s name – I don\\'t really\\nknow shit about what he does or how he does it – That\\ndon\\'t give me much to bargain with.\\nMAX\\nGive \\'em what you got. Offer to help. Show a willingness to\\nbe helpful. You want to stay out of jail, don\\'t you?\\nMax looks at Jackie thinking about something.\\nMAX (CONT\\'D)\\nWhat\\'dya think?\\nCLOSEUP JACKIE\\nJACKIE\\nI think maybe I have more options than I thought.\\nDISSOLVE TO:\\nCLOSEUP: ORDELL\\nSitting in his black Mercedes, parked across the street from Jackie\\'s apartment building in\\nHawthorne. Johnny Cash is playing inside his car.}\\nEXT. JACKIE\\'S APARTMENT COMPLEX – NIGHT\\nORDELL\\'S POV\\nThrough the windshield, he sees Max\\'s powder-blue Cadillac Seville pull up to Jackie\\'s\\napartment. She gets out, ten bends down and talks to him through the window of the passenger\\nside door. Then makes a goobye gesture and turns, walking into her apartment complex. Max\\ndrives off.\\nORDELL\\nWhile Johnny Cash continues crooning, Ordell puts on his gloves. Then opens up his glovebox,\\ntaking out a little Targa .22 pistol. He steps out of the car, slipping the pistol into his coat\\npocket. We STEDICAM  in front of him as he walks across the street to Jackie\\'s apartment.\\nOnce inside the complex, Ordell passes us and WE FOLLOW BEHIND HIM , up to Jackie\\'s\\nground-floor apartment door.\\nHe gives it a soft knock with one knuckle. He waits a moment, then Jackie opens the door.\\nORDELL\\nHow you doing, Ms. Jackie?\\nJACKIE\\nI was expecting you. Come in.\\nJackie holds the door open for him.\\nINT. JACKIE\\'S APARTMENT – NIGHT\\nOrdell steps inside. He moves over by a halogen lamp in the living room.\\nORDELL\\nYou got some booze?\\nJackie still standing by the door. She doesn\\'t look frightened.\\nJACKIE\\nI got some vodka in the freezer.\\nORDELL\\nGot some o.j.?\\nJACKIE\\nYeah.\\nOrdell turns the halogen lamp to dim.\\nORDELL\\nWell, then, why don\\'t you be a good hostess and make me a\\nscrewdriver?\\nJACKIE\\nSure.}\\nJackie moves into the kitchen area. Ordell follows her, hanging in the doorway, while she\\nmakes the drink. Jackie doesn\\'t turn on the light.\\nORDELL\\nYou gonna thank me?\\nTaking a glass from the cupboard.\\nJACKIE\\nFor what?\\nORDELL\\nWho you think got your ass outta jail?\\nOpening the freezer and filling a glass with ice cubes and taking out vodka.\\nJACKIE\\nThe same guy who put me in, thanks a lot.\\nORDELL\\nHey, you get caught with blow, that\\'s our business.\\nOpens refrigerator, light cuts into the kitchen. She takes out orange juice, then closes the door.\\nJACKIE\\nIt wasn\\'t mine.\\nOrdell has to stop and think.\\nJackie makes screwdriver.\\nORDELL\\nOh, shit. I bet it was that present Mr. Walker was sending\\nMelanie. Yaaaah, he\\'s the one musta put it in there if you\\ndidn\\'t. Oh, man, that shit\\'s uncalled for, baby, and I\\napologize. I \\'magine they asked you a shitload of questions\\nabout it, huh? All that money, want to know where you got\\nit?\\nJackie doesn\\'t answer. She just walks up to Ordell handing him his yellow drink in the\\ndarkness. Ordell takes it, continues to look at Jackie.\\nORDELL (CONT\\'D)\\nI\\'magine they asked who you givin\\' it to, too.\\nJACKIE\\nThey asked.\\nORDELL\\nAnd what was your answer?\\nJACKIE\\nI said I wanted to talk to a lawyer.}\\nORDELL\\nYou positive about that? You weren\\'t nervous and let\\nsomething slip by mistake? If you did, I ain\\'t mad, I just\\ngotta know.\\nJackie says to his face;\\nJACKIE\\nYou\\'re not asking the right questions.\\nThen she walks past him back to the living room. She goes over to the halogen lamp, turning\\nthe light up brighter, then moves by the door, still standing and looking at Ordell in the kitchen\\ndoorway.\\nJACKIE\\nBeaumont Livingston.\\nORDELL\\nI knew it.\\nJACKIE\\nAnd they asked if I knew Mr. Walker.\\nOrdell by the halogen lamp. He turns it back to dim.\\nORDELL\\nYeah?\\nJACKIE\\nI didn\\'t tell \\'em anything.\\nOrdell moves slowly towards Jackie.\\nORDELL\\nMy name come up?\\nJackie slowly shakes her head \"no.\"\\nOrdell directly in front of Jackie, he gently places his gloved hands on her shoulders.\\nORDELL (CONT\\'D)\\nYou say anything about me?\\nJackie shakes her head \"no.\"\\nORDELL (CONT\\'D)\\nWell, that\\'s mighty honorable of you.\\nOrdell\\'s gloved fingertips move up her collarbone to her throat, gently touching her skin. Jackie\\nlocks eyes with his, but still shows no fear.\\nORDELL (CONT\\'D)\\nThis fella Beaumont, they say what happened to him?\\nJACKIE\\nThey told me.}\\nAt this moment the film becomes a:\\nSPLIT SCREEN\\nOn the RIGHT-HAND SIDE  is Ordell with his hands barely touching Jackie\\'s throat. On the\\nLEFT-HAND SIDE  is Max driving home in his Seville.\\nMAX IN CAR\\nMax drives home, an almost moony romantic look no his face. He can\\'t stop thinking about\\nJackie. During the night she\\'d have a gleam in her eyes, the look saying; \"WE COULD HAVE\\nFUN\". Unless she was appraising kinda him with the look, making a judgment and what it said\\nwas; \"I COULD USE YOU\". Either way it was a turn-on.\\nMax pulls into the driveway of his small house in Torrance.\\nORDELL AND JACKIE\\nORDELL\\nYeah, somebody musta been real mad at Beaumont. Or\\nthey were afraid of what he might say to keep from doin\\nsome time. I\\'magine from time-to-time they asked you a\\nwhole shitload of questions. And you didn\\'t give \\'em no\\nanswer?\\nJackie shakes her head from side to side.\\nOrdell moves his thumbs from her collarbone to the middle of her throat.\\nORDELL\\nYou scared of me?\\nJackie shakes her head from side to side without her eyes leaving his. Reaches over the seat\\nORDELL\\nYou got a reason to be nervous with me?\\nWith his hands on Jackie\\'s throat, staring into the woman\\'s eyes, from BELOW FRAME  then\\nfeels something hard the fuck against his crotch. Neither break eye contact.\\nOrdell hears a CLICK.\\nCan\\'t believe it.\\nMAX IN CAR\\nMax takes his keys, then to the glove box...\\nTHE GLOVE BOX\\nThe gun is gone.}\\nMAX\\nWhere is it?\\nA CLOSEUP OF MAX\\'S GUN IN ORDELL ORDELL\\'S CROTCH\\nORDELL\\nIs that what I think it is?\\nJACKIE\\nWhat do you think it is?\\nCLOSEUP GUN IN CROTCH\\nORDELL\\nI think it\\'s a gun pressing against my dick.\\nJACKIE\\nYou thought right... Now take your hands from around my\\nthroat, nigga.\\nOrdell flashes his hustler\\'s smile and lets go.\\nEND OF SPLIT SCREEN\\nJackie turns Ordell around, gun firmly in his back, and pushes him against the wall.\\nORDELL\\nWhat the hell you doin\\'?\\nJACKIE\\nShut your ass up and grab the wall!\\nJackie has Ordell against the wall and is frisking him the way a cop would. She finds the .22\\npistol in his pocket\\nORDELL\\nNow, baby, that\\'s got nothin\\' to do with you. I just carry\\nthat. You been listenin\\' to them cops too much.\\nJACKIE\\nThe cops didn\\'t try and strangle my ass.\\nORDELL\\nDamn, Jackie, I was just playin\\' with you.\\nJACKIE\\nWell, I ain\\'t playin with you.

And if I don\\'t, I go to jail.\\nOrdell, very interested.\\nORDELL\\nYeah?\\nJACKIE\\nOne hundred thousand put in an escrow account in my\\nname, if I\\'m convicted up to a year, or put on probation.

I\\'ll go get it.\\nShe leaves FRAME , and Max enters it, closing the door behind him. Max stands by the door, a\\nlittle surprised and a touch pissed at the nonchalantness.\\nAs he stands on the threshold to her living room, waiting for her to return with the gun, feeling\\nfoolish, he thinks about hauling her ass back to the stockade. That\\'ll change her expression,\\nhe\\'d bet.\\nShe returns from the bedroom, gun in hand, wearing a sort of sad smile.\\nJACKIE (CONT\\'D)\\nMax, I\\'m sorry. I was afraid if I asked to borrow it you\\'d\\nsay no. You\\'d have to. Would you like some coffee?\\nThen, as quickly as the anger rose in Max, it dissipates completely, leaving only curiosity.\\nMAX\\nIf you\\'re having some.\\nJACKIE\\nI am. Have a seat.\\nJackie head to the kitchen, making the coffee. Max sits at the dining table off of the kitchen.\\nMAX\\nYou get a chance to use it?\\nJACKIE\\nI felt a lot safer having it. My milk went bad when I was in\\njail.\\nMAX\\nBlack\\'s fine.\\nShe puts a finger in the coffeemaker and starts scooping coffee in it.\\nMAX (CONT\\'D)\\nYou want to hang on to it awhile? It wouldn\\'t be legal, but\\nif it makes –\\nJackie goes to the sink, filling the coffee pot.}\\nJACKIE\\nThanks, but I have my own now.\\nMAX\\nYou went out this morning and bought a gun?\\nShe turns off the water.\\nJACKIE\\nWhat, I couldn\\'t hear you?\\nMAX\\nYou went out this morning and bought a gun.\\nPouring water into the coffee machine.\\nJACKIE\\nLet\\'s just say I got one, okay?\\nShe turns on the coffeemaker.\\nMAX\\nSomebody loan it to you?\\nJACKIE\\nYeah.\\nJackie leaves the kitchen.\\nMax\\'s eyes follow her to the living room.\\nJACKIE (CONT\\'D)\\nWant to hear some music?\\nMAX\\nSure.\\nJackie ends her knees and goes through a stack of records leaned up against the wall on the\\nfloor.\\nJACKIE\\nI couldn\\'t wait till I got home last night and wash my hair.\\nMAX\\nIt looks nice.\\nShe finds a record, takes it out of the pile, removes the album from the sleeve, and places it on\\nher stereo turntable.\\nMAX (CONT\\'D)\\nYou never got into the whole CD revolution?\\nJACKIE\\nI got a few. But I can\\'t afford to start all over again. I got\\ntoo much time and money invested in my records.\\nThe song starts; it\\'s an old romantic soul music number from the early seventies.}\\nMAX\\nYeah, but you can\\'t get new stuff on records.\\nJackie picks up her cigarettes off the coffee table.\\nJACKIE\\nI don\\'t buy new stuff that often.\\nJackie enters the kitchen door frame by Max. She lights a cigarette and stands.\\nMax listens to the soul song.\\nMAX\\nThis is pretty.\\nJACKIE\\nUh-huh.\\nMAX\\nWho is this?\\nJACKIE\\nThe Delfonics.\\nMAX\\n\\'76?\\nJACKIE\\n\\'74, I think.\\nMAX\\nIt\\'s nice.\\nThey listen for a moment.\\nJACKIE\\nI called in sick this morning. As far as the airline knows,\\nI\\'m still available.\\nMAX\\nAre you?\\nJACKIE\\nI don\\'t know yet. \\'m going to talk with Dargus and Nicolet\\ntoday. Do what you suggested. Offer to help and see what\\nhappens.\\nMAX\\nWhat I meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you.\\nJACKIE\\nI want to talk to them first. I know more now about\\nOrdell\\'s money.\\nMAX\\nWell, if the A.T.F. guy is the one who wants you, that\\'ll only\\ninterest him up to a point.}\\nJACKIE\\nIt\\'s a lot of money. About a half-a-million dollars. All of it\\nin Cabo in safe deposit boxes and more comin in.\\nMAX\\nHow\\'d you find that out?\\nJACKIE\\nHe told me last night.\\nMAX\\nHe called you?\\nJACKIE\\nHe came by.\\nMAX\\nWhat?... What\\'d you do?\\nJACKIE\\nWe talked.\\nJackie goes back in the kitchen. Coffee\\'s almost there, but not quite. She pulls down two mugs\\nfrom a cabinet.\\nJACKIE (CONT\\'D)\\nHe had his doubts at first. But he\\'s always trusted me an\\nwants more than anything to believe he still can.\\nMAX\\nWhy?\\nJACKIE\\nHe needs me. Without me all that money is just gonna sit\\nover there in Cabo. Sugar?\\nMAX\\nNo thanks. There\\'s gotta be other ways to get it out.\\nShe pours the coffee.\\nJACKIE\\nMaybe, but \\'m the only one he\\'s ever used. He can\\'t trust\\nhis other people. They\\'re crooks. He can try bringing I in\\nhimself, but Ordell sure don\\'t want to go through no\\nCustoms line. Either he recruits another Cabo stewardess,\\nor he continues to trust me. I made him feel he still can.\\nJackie walks to the table with the two coffee mugs and sits down.\\nMAX\\nHow do you get it out?\\nJACKIE\\nSame way I been don\\', but first they got to let me go back to\\nwork.}\\nMAX\\nYou\\'re gonna offer to set him up?\\nJACKIE\\nIf I get let off. Otherwise, fuck \\'em.\\nMAX\\nIt\\'s very possible Ordell\\'s killed somebody.\\nJACKIE\\nI ain\\'t goin\\' to jail, and I ain\\'t doin\\' that probation thing\\nagain.\\nMax watches her a moment\\nJackie takes a drink of coffee.\\nJACKIE (CONT\\'D)\\nHow do you feel about getting old?\\nMAX\\nYou\\'re not old. You look great.\\nJACKIE\\nI\\'m asking how you feel. Does it bother you?\\nMAX\\nIt\\'s not really something I think about.\\nJACKIE\\nReally?\\nMAX\\nOkay, I\\'m a little sensitive about my hair. It started falling\\nout ten years ago. So I did something about it.\\nJACKIE\\nHow\\'d you feel about it?\\nMAX\\nI\\'m fine with it, or I wouldn\\'t of done it, I did it to feel\\nbetter about myself, and I do. When I look in the mirror it\\nlooks like me.\\nJACKIE\\nIt\\'s different with men.\\nMAX\\nYou know, I can\\'t really feel too sorry for you in that\\ndepartment.\\nJackie smiles.\\nMAX (CONT\\'D)\\nIn fact, I\\'d make a bet that except possibly for an Afro –\\nyou look exactly the same as you did at twenty nine.}\\nJackie smiles into her coffee.\\nJACKIE\\nMy ass ain\\'t the same.\\nMAX\\nBigger?\\nJACKIE\\nYeah.\\nMax smiles.\\nMAX\\nNothin wrong with that.\\nJackie\\'s smile grows bigger.\\nMAX (CONT\\'D)\\nDoes something else worry you?\\nJACKIE\\nI just feel like I\\'m always starting over. You said how many\\nbonds you wrote?\\nMAX\\nFifteen thousand.\\nJACKIE\\nWell, I\\'ve flown seven million miles. And I\\'ve been waitin\\'\\non people almost twenty years. The best job I could get\\nafter my bust was Cabo Air, which is about the worst job\\nyou can get in this industry. I make about sixteen thousand,\\nwith retirement benefits , ain\\'t worth a damn. And now\\nwith this arrest hanging over my head, I\\'m scared. If I lose\\nmy job I gotta start all over again, but I got nothin to start\\nover with. I\\'ll be stuck with whatever I can get.

JACKIE\\'S APARTMENT – NIGHT\\nMax sits on the couch in Jackie\\'s apartment drinking white wine.\\nJackie paces in front of him, white wine in one hand, Davidoff in the other, going over the\\ndetails of tomorrow. One could notice a slight change in Jackie.\\nThere\\'s a bit of an edge to Miss Brown that\\'s bubbling underneath her cool surface. It\\'s\\nunderstandable. After all, she\\'s been the architect of this half-a-million dollars switcheroo.\\nShe\\'s moved heaven and earth to make all the pieces fall into place, and all the players thnk\\nwhat she wants them to think.\\nAs she talks to Max she knows tomorrow all her hard work will either fail or succeed. But don\\'t\\ntake this difference the wrong way. This edge I\\'m referring to is not one born out of fear\\n(Jackie\\'s nervous, but she\\'s not afraid). It\\'s more the edge an athlete might feel before an all-\\nimportant competition.\\nJACKIE\\nI told them Ordell\\'s changed the amount he\\'s bringing in.\\nMAX\\nDo you think they bought it?\\nJACKIE\\nOh, yeah. I got them thinking Ordell\\'s real nervous.

Everything\\'s the same except one change. Ordell\\nthinks it\\'s just too hot right now to bring in all his money.\\nHe knows you\\'re watching him, and he\\'s paranoid.

Ray believed it.\\nMAX\\nBut you still have to show him the money at the airport.\\nJACKIE\\nWell, you know I\\'m not going to show him the whole\\namount. He\\'ll see fifty thousand.\\nMAX\\nWhere\\'s the rest of it?\\nJACKIE\\nIn the bag underneath.\\nMAX\\nWhat if he checks it?\\nJACKIE\\nHe won\\'t – I mean, he didn\\'t the last time. He\\'ll be\\nexpecting fifty thousand and there it is – on top.\\nMAX\\nYou\\'re takin\\' a helluva chance kid.\\nJACKIE\\nNot really. If he finds it, I say Mr. Walker put the money in,\\nand I didn\\'t know nothing about it. Like the coke.\\nMAX\\nThen you\\'re out and you get nothing.\\nJACKIE\\nYeah, but I\\'m not in jail and I tried.\\nMAX\\nYou\\'re gonna have surveillance all over you.\\nJACKIE\\nThat\\'s why you don\\'t make a move till I come out of the\\nfitting room.}\\nMAX\\nIn a dress.\\nJACKIE\\nWell, a suit.

I told you before, Melanie wasn\\'t\\npart of the plan. Ordell must of told her to do it. She bursts\\nin, grabs the shopping bag, and takes off. What am I\\nsupposed to do, go after her? I\\'m in my fucking underwear.\\nI had to get dressed before I could do anything. So I put\\nthis back on \\'cause could put this on faster than I could my\\nuniform.\\nNICOLET\\nYou took the time to pay the saleswoman.\\nJACKIE\\nI had to. I was frantic. I didn\\'t know what to do.\\nNICOLET\\nWhat did you do after that?\\nJACKIE\\nI went looking for you. I went straight to the bookstore,\\n\\'cause that\\'s where you were last time, but you weren\\'t\\nthere. How the hell else am I supposed to let anybody know\\nwhat happened? You didn\\'t tell me how to do that, did\\nyou? I knew I was under surveillance, so when I couldn\\'t\\nspot anybody, I started yelling.\\nNICOLET\\nThere was a guy with Melanie?\\nJACKIE\\nNot in the fitting room.\\nCUT TO:\\nA YOUNG WOMAN A.T.F SURVEILLANCE AGENT\\nPretends to shop. She watches Louis grab Melanie.\\nNICOLET (V.O.)\\nWe had our agent on you.

The white guy takes the\\nshopping bag and they go.\\nBACK TO OFFICE\\nNICOLET\\nThis guy with Melanie, that was Louis Gara?\\nJACKIE\\nI didn\\'t see him. I was in my underwear.

L.A.P.D. found him dead in a car on\\nNinth. And we\\'ve lost Ordell.\\nJACKIE\\nI thought you were watching him.\\nNICOLET\\nWe were, and we lost him. He walked into a strip bar\\nsometime around three thirty and never came out. The bar\\nwas on Ninth, less than a mile-and-a-half from where Louis\\nwas found dead. It looks like Louis\\'s friend shot him twice\\nat point blank range.\\nJACKIE\\nSo what happens now?\\nNICOLET\\nWe pick up Ordell. We\\'ve got three murders we can link\\nhim to. We have the storage unit where he keeps his guns,\\nby tomorrow we\\'ll have a search warrant to go in and get\\nhim. And we have you.\\nJACKIE\\nWhat about me?}\\nNICOLET\\nWhat about you?\\nJACKIE\\nDo you think I took some of that money?\\nNICOLET\\nI have no evidence of your taking anything. You didn\\'t pay\\nfor your snazzy new suit with marked bills; I was glad to\\nsee that. You\\'ve been helping us out, you gave us Melanie\\nand Louis. Melanie had a packet of marked bills stuffed in\\nher shorts when they found her, which goes a long way\\nbacking up your story.\\nJackie listens.\\nNICOLET (CONT\\'D)\\nI\\'ll settle for Ordell with the marked bills.\\nNICOLET\\nIf you have something else going on you haven\\'t told me\\nabout, it\\'s between you and Ordell. All I gotta say is, you\\nbetter hope we find him before he finds you.\\nDISSOLVE TO:\\nCLOSEUP ORDELL\\nOn the phone.\\nORDEL\\n... I can\\'t leave here today...

COFFEE SHOP – MORNING\\nA normal Denny\\'s, Spires-like coffee shop in Los Angeles. It\\'s\\nabout 9:00 in the morning. While the place isn\\'t jammed, there\\'s a\\nhealthy number of people drinking coffee, munching on bacon and\\neating eggs.\\nTwo of these people are a YOUNG MAN and a YOUNG WOMAN. The Young\\nMan has a slight working-class English accent and, like his fellow\\ncountryman, smokes cigarettes like they\\'re going out of style.\\nIt is impossible to tell where the Young Woman is from or how old\\nshe is; everything she does contradicts something she did. The boy\\nand girl sit in a booth. Their dialogue is to be said in a rapid-\\npace \"HIS GIRL FRIDAY\" fashion.\\nYOUNG MAN\\nNo, forget it, it\\'s too risky. I\\'m through\\ndoin\\' that shit.\\nYOUNG WOMAN\\nYou always say that, the same thing every\\ntime: never again, I\\'m through, too\\ndangerous.\\nYOUNG MAN\\nI know that\\'s what I always say. I\\'m\\nalways right too, but –\\nYOUNG WOMAN\\n– but you forget about it in a day or two\\n–\\nYOUNG MAN\\n– yeah, well, the days of me forgittin\\'\\nare over, and the days of me rememberin\\'\\nhave just begun.\\nYOUNG WOMAN\\nWhen you go on like this, you know what\\nyou sound like?\\nYOUNG MAN\\nI sound like a sensible fucking man, is\\nwhat I sound like.}\\nYOUNG WOMAN\\nYou sound like a duck.\\n(imitates a duck)\\nQuack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack,\\nquack...\\nYOUNG MAN\\nWell take heart, \\'cause you\\'re never gonna\\nhafta hear it again.

There probably never was a\\nlittle girl – the point of the story isn\\'t\\nthe little girl. The point of the story is\\nthey robbed the bank with a telephone.\\nYOUNG WOMAN\\nYou wanna rob banks?\\nYOUNG MAN\\nI\\'m not sayin\\' I wanna rob banks, I\\'m just\\nillustrating that if we did, it would be\\neasier than what we been doin\\'.\\nYOUNG WOMAN\\nSo you don\\'t want to be a bank robber?\\nYOUNG MAN\\nNaw, all those guys are goin\\' down the\\nsame road, either dead or servin\\' twenty.\\nYOUNG WOMAN\\nAnd no more liquor stores?\\nYOUNG MAN\\nWhat have we been talking about? Yeah, no-\\nmore-liquor-stores. Besides, it ain\\'t the\\ngiggle it usta be. Too many foreigners own\\nliquor stores. Vietnamese, Koreans, they\\ncan\\'t fuckin\\' speak English. You tell \\'em:\\n\"Empty out the register,\" and they don\\'t\\nknow what it fuckin\\' means. They make it\\ntoo personal. We keep on, one of those\\ngook motherfuckers\\' gonna make us kill\\n\\'em.\\nYOUNG WOMAN\\nI\\'m not gonna kill anybody.}\\nYOUNG MAN\\nI don\\'t wanna kill anybody either. But\\nthey\\'ll probably put us in a situation\\nwhere it\\'s us of them. And if it\\'s not the\\ngooks, it these old Jews who\\'ve owned the\\nstore for fifteen fuckin\\' generations.

It\\'s a coffee shop.\\nYOUNG MAN\\nWhat\\'s wrong with that? People never rob\\nrestaurants, why not? Bars, liquor stores,\\ngas stations, you get your head blown off\\nstickin\\' up one of them. Restaurants, on\\nthe other hand, you catch with their pants\\ndown. They\\'re not expecting to get robbed,\\nor not as expecting.\\nYOUNG WOMAN\\n(taking to idea)\\nI bet in places like this you couldcut\\ndown on the hero factor.}\\nYOUNG MAN\\nCorrect. Just like banks, these places are\\ninsured. The managers don\\'t give a fuck,\\nthey\\'re just tryin\\' to get ya out the door\\nbefore you start pluggin\\' diners.\\nWaitresses, forget it, they ain\\'t takin\\' a\\nbullet for the register. Busboys, some\\nwetback gettin\\' paid a dollar fifty a hour\\ngonna really give a fuck you\\'re stealin\\'\\nfrom the owner. Customers are sittin\\'\\nthere with food in their mouths, they\\ndon\\'t know what\\'s goin\\' on. One minute\\nthey\\'re havin\\' a Denver omelette, next\\nminute somebody\\'s stickin\\' a gun in their\\nface.\\nThe Young Woman visibly takes in the idea. The Young Man continues\\nin a low voice.\\nYOUNG MAN\\nSee, I got the idea last liquor store we\\nstuck up. \\'Member all those customers kept\\ncomin\\' in?\\nYOUNG WOMAN\\nYeah.\\nYOUNG MAN\\nThey you got the idea to take everybody\\'s\\nwallet.\\nYOUNG WOMAN\\nUh-huh.\\nYOUNG MAN\\nThat was a good idea.\\nYOUNG WOMAN\\nThanks.\\nYOUNG MAN\\nWe made more from the wallets then we did\\nthe register.\\nYOUNG WOMAN\\nYes we did.\\nYOUNG MAN\\nA lot of people go to restaurants.\\nYOUNG WOMAN\\nA lot of wallets.\\nYOUNG MAN\\nPretty smart, huh?\\nThe Young Woman scans the restaurant with this new information.\\nShe sees all the PATRONS eating, lost in conversations. The tires\\nWAITRESS, taking orders. The BUSBOYS going through the motions,}\\ncollecting dishes. The MANAGER complaining to the COOK about\\nsomething. A smiles breaks out on the Young Woman\\'s face.\\nYOUNG WOMAN\\nPretty smart.\\n(into it)\\nI\\'m ready, let\\'s go, right here, right\\nnow.\\nYOUNG MAN\\nRemember, same as before, you\\'re crowd\\ncontrol, I handle the employees.\\nYOUNG WOMAN\\nGot it.\\nThey both take out their .32-caliber pistols and lay them on the\\ntable. He looks at her and she back at him.\\nYOUNG WOMAN\\nI love you, Pumpkin.\\nYOUNG MAN\\nI love you, Honey Bunny.\\nAnd with that, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny grab their weapons, stand\\nup and rob the restaurant. Pumpkin\\'s robbery persona is that of\\nthe in-control professional. Honey Bunny\\'s is that of the\\npsychopathic, hair-triggered, loose cannon.\\nPUMPKIN\\n(yelling to all)\\nEverybody be cool this is a robbery!\\nHONEY BUNNY\\nAny of you fuckin\\' pricks move and I\\'ll\\nexecute every one of you motherfuckers!\\nGot that?\\nCUT TO:\\nCREDIT SEQUENCE:\\n\"PULP FICTION\"\\nINT. \\'74 CHEVY (MOVING) – MORNING\\nAn old gas guzzling, dirty, white 1974 Chevy Nova BARRELS down a\\nhomeless-ridden street in Hollywood.

JACKRABBIT SLIM\\'S – NIGHT\\nIn the past six years, 50\\'s diners have sprung up all over L.A.,\\ngiving Thai restaurants a run for their money. They\\'re all\\nbasically the same. Decor out of an \"Archie\" comic book, Golden\\nOldies constantly emanating from a bubbly Wurlitzer, saucy\\nwaitresses in bobby socks, menus with items like the Fats Domino\\nCheeseburger, or the Wolfman Jack Omelette, and over prices that\\npay for all this bullshit.\\nBut then there\\'s JACKRABBIT SLIM\\'S, the big mama of 50\\'s diners.\\nEither the best or the worst, depending on your point of view.}\\nVincent\\'s Malibu pulls up to the restaurant. A big sign with a\\nneon figure of a cartoon surly cool cat jackrabbit in a red\\nwindbreaker towers over the establishment. Underneath the cartoon\\nis the name: JACKRABBIT SLIM\\'S.

Dotted lines appear on the\\nscreen, forming a sqaure. The lines disperse.\\nVINCENT\\nAfter you, kitty-cat.\\nINT. JACKRABBIT SLIM\\'S – NIGHT\\nCompared to the interior, the exterior was that of a quaint\\nEnglish pub. Posters from 50\\'s A.I.P. movies are all over the wall\\n(\"ROCK ALL NIGHT,\" \"HIGH SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL,\" \"ATTACK OF THE CRAB\\nMONSTER,\" and \"MACHINE GUN KELLY\"). The booths that the patrons\\nsit in are made out of the cut up bodies of 50s cars.\\nIn the middle of the restaurant in a dance floor. A big sign on\\nthe wall states, \"No shoes allowed.\"So wannabe beboppers (actually\\nMelrose-types), do the twist in their socks or barefeet.\\nThe picture windows don\\'t look out the street, but instead, B & W\\nmovies of 50\\'s street scenes play behind them. The WAITRESSES and\\nWAITERS are made up as replicas of 50\\'s icons: MARILYN MONROE,\\nZORRO, JAMES DEAN, DONNA REED, MARTIN and LEWIS, and THE PHILIP\\nMORRIS MIDGET, wait on tables wearing appropriate costumes.\\nVincent and Mia study the menu in a booth made out of a red \\'59\\nEdsel.

The YUPPIES are dancing,\\nthe DINERS are biting into big, juicy hamburgers, and the icons\\nare playing their parts. Marilyn is squealing, The Midget is\\npaging Philip Morris, Donna Reed is making her customers drink\\ntheir milk, and Dean and Jerry are acting a fool.\\nMIA\\nWhaddya think?\\nVINCENT\\nIt\\'s like a wax museum with a pulse rate.}\\nVincent takes out his pouch of tobacco and begins rolling himself\\na smoke.\\nAfter a second of watching him –\\nMIA\\nWhat are you doing?\\nVINCENT\\nRollin\\' a smoke.\\nMIA\\nHere?\\nVINCENT\\nIt\\'s just tobacco.\\nMIA\\nOh. Well in that case, will you roll me\\none, cowboy?\\nAs he finishes licking it –\\nVINCENT\\nYou can have his one, cowgirl.\\nHe hands her the rolled smoke. She takes it, putting it to her\\nlips. Out of nowhere appears a Zippo lighter in Vincent\\'s hand. He\\nlights it.\\nMIA\\nThanks.\\nVINCENT\\nThink nothing of it.\\nHe begins rolling one for himself.\\nAs this time, the SOUND of a subway car fills the diner, making\\neverything SHAKE and RATTLE. Marilyn Monroe runs to a square vent\\nin the floor. An imaginary subway train BLOWS the skirt of her\\nwhite dress around her ears as she lets out a squeal. The entire\\nrestaurant applauds.\\nBack to Mia and Vincent.\\nMIA\\nMarsellus said you just got back from\\nAmsterdam.\\nVINCENT\\nSure did. I heard you did a pilot.\\nMIA\\nThat was my fifteen minutes.\\nVINCENT\\nWhat was it?}\\nMIA\\nIt was show about a team of female secret\\nagents called \"Fox Force Five.\"\\nVINCENT\\nWhat?\\nMIA\\n\"Fox Force Five.\"Fox, as in we\\'re a bunch\\nof foxy chicks. Force, as in we\\'re a force\\nto be reckoned with. Five, as in there\\'s\\none... two ... three... four... five of\\nus. There was a blonde one, Sommerset\\nO\\'Neal from that show \"Baton Rouge,\" she\\nwas the leader. A Japanese one, a black\\none, a French one and a brunette one, me.\\nWe all had special skills. Sommerset had a\\nphotographic memory, the Japanese fox was\\na kung fu master, the black girl was a\\ndemolition expert, the French fox\\'\\nspecialty was sex...\\nVINCENT\\nWhat was your specialty?\\nMIA\\nKnives. The character I played, Raven\\nMcCoy, her background was she was raised\\nby circus performers. So she grew up doing\\na knife act. According to the show, she\\nwas the deadliest woman in the world with\\na knife. But because she grew up in a\\ncircus, she was also something of an\\nacrobat. She could do illusions, she was a\\ntrapeze artist – when you\\'re keeping the\\nworld safe from evil, you never know when\\nbeing a trapeze artist\\'s gonna come in\\nhandy. And she knew a zillion old jokes\\nher grandfather, an old vaudevillian,\\ntaught her. If we woulda got picked up,\\nthey woulda worked in a gimmick where\\nevery episode I woulda told and ol joke.\\nVINCENT\\nDo you remember any of the jokes?\\nMIA\\nWell I only got the chance to say one,\\n\\'cause we only did one show.\\nVINCENT\\nTell me.\\nMIA\\nNo. It\\'s really corny.\\nVINCENT\\nC\\'mon, don\\'t be that way.}\\nMIA\\nNo. You won\\'t like it and I\\'ll be\\nembarrassed.\\nVINCENT\\nYou told it in front of fifty million\\npeople and you can\\'t tell it to me? I\\npromise I won\\'t laugh.\\nMIA\\n(laughing)\\nThat\\'s what I\\'m afraid of.\\nVINCENT\\nThat\\'s not what I meant and you know it.\\nMIA\\nYou\\'re quite the silver tongue devil,\\naren\\'t you?\\nVINCENT\\nI meant I wouldn\\'t laugh at you.\\nMIA\\nThat\\'s not what you said Vince. Well now\\nI\\'m definitely not gonna tell ya, \\'cause\\nit\\'s been built up too much.\\nVINCENT\\nWhat a gyp.\\nBuddy comes back with the drinks. Mia wraps her lips around the\\nstraw of her shake.\\nMIA\\nYummy!\\nVINCENT\\nCan I have a sip of that? I\\'d like to know\\nwhat a five-dollar shake tastes like.\\nMIA\\nBe my guest.\\nShe slides the shake over to him.\\nMIA\\nYou can use my straw, I don\\'t have\\nkooties.\\nVincent smiles.\\nVINCENT\\nYeah, but maybe I do.\\nMIA\\nKooties I can handle.\\nHe takes a sip.}\\nVINCENT\\n Goddamn! That\\'s a pretty fuckin\\' good\\nmilk shake.\\nMIA\\nTold ya.\\nVINCENT\\nI don\\'t know if it\\'s worth five dollars,\\nbut it\\'s pretty fuckin\\'  good.\\nHe slides the shake back.\\nThen the first of an uncomfortable silence happens.\\nMIA\\nDon\\'t you hate that?\\nVINCENT\\nWhat?\\nMIA\\nUncomfortable silences. Why do we feel\\nit\\'s necessary to yak about bullshit in\\norder to be comfortable?\\nVINCENT\\nI don\\'t know.\\nMIA\\nThat\\'s when you know you found somebody\\nspecial.

This sounds like you actually\\nhave something to say.\\nVINCENT\\nOnly if you promise not to get offended.}\\nMIA\\nYou can\\'t promise something like that. I\\nhave no idea what you\\'re gonna ask. You\\ncould ask me what you\\'re gonna ask me, and\\nmy natural response could be to be\\noffended. Then, through no fault of my\\nown, I woulda broken my promise.\\nVINCENT\\nThen let\\'s just forget it.\\nMIA\\nThat is an impossibility.

But that doesn\\'t\\nmean it didn\\'t happen. I heard Marsellus\\nis very protective of you.\\nMIA\\nA husband being protective of his wife is\\none thing. A husband almost killing\\nanother man for touching his wife\\'s feet\\nis something else.\\nVINCENT\\nBut did it happen?}\\nMIA\\nThe only thing Antwan ever touched of mine\\nwas my hand, when he shook it. I met Anwan\\nonce – at my wedding – then never again.\\nThe truth is, nobody knows why Marsellus\\ntossed Tony Rocky Horror out of that\\nwindow except Marsellus and Tony Rocky\\nHorror.

The speakers BLAST OUT a high energy\\ncountry number, which Mia plays air-guitar to. She dances her way\\naround the room and finds herself by Vincent\\'s overcoat hanging on\\nthe rack. She touches its sleeve. It feels good.\\nHer hand hoes in its pocket and pulls out his tobacco pouch. Like\\na little girl playing cowboy, she spreads the tobacco on some\\nrolling paper. Imitating what he did earlier, licks the paper and\\nrolls it into a pretty good cigarette. Maybe a little too fat, but\\nnot bad for a first try. Mia thinks so anyway. Her hand reaches\\nback in the pocket and pulls out his Zippo lighter. She SLAPS the\\nlighter against her leg, trying to light it fancy-style like Vince\\ndid. What do you know, she did it! Mia\\'s one happy clam. She\\ntriumphantly brings the fat flame up to her fat smoke, lighting it\\nup, then LOUDLY SNAPS the Zippo closed.\\nThe Mia-made cigarette is brought up to her lips, and she takes a\\nlong, cool drag. Her hand slides the Zippo back in the overcoat\\npocket. But wait, her fingers touch something else. Those fingers\\nbring out a plastic bag with white powder inside, the madman that\\nVincent bought earlier from Lance. Wearing a big smile, Mia brings\\nthe bag of heroin up to her face.\\nMIA\\n(like you would say Bingo!)\\nDisco! Vince, you little cola nut, you\\'ve\\nbeen holding out on me.\\nCUT TO:\\nINT.

Then... the\\nrush hits...\\nBATHROOM\\nVincent dries his hands on a towel while he continues his dialogue\\nwith the mirror.\\nVINCENT\\n... It\\'s a moral test of yourself, whether\\nor not you can maintain loyalty. Because\\nwhen people are loyal to each other,\\nthat\\'s very meaningful.\\nLIVING ROOM\\nMia is on all fours trying to crawl to the bathroom, but it\\'s like\\nshe\\'s trying to crawl with the bones removed from her knees.

It was bought\\nduring the First World War in a little\\ngeneral store in Knoxville, Tennessee. It\\nwas bought by private Doughboy Ernie\\nCoolidge the day he set sail for Paris. It\\nwas your great-granddaddy\\'s war watch,\\nmade by the first company to ever make\\nwrist watches. You see, up until then,\\npeople just carried pocket watches. Your\\ngreat-granddaddy wore that watch every day\\nhe was in the war. Then when he had done\\nhis duty, he went home to your great-\\ngrandmother, took the watch off his wrist\\nand put it in an ol\\' coffee can. And in\\nthat can it stayed \\'til your grandfather\\nDane Coolidge was called upon by his\\ncountry to go overseas and fight the\\nGermans once again. This time they called\\nit World War Two. Your great-granddaddy\\ngave it to your granddad for good luck.\\nUnfortunately, Dane\\'s luck wasn\\'t as good\\nas his old man\\'s. Your granddad was a\\n(MORE)}\\nCAPT.

None of those boys had any\\nillusions about ever leavin\\' that island\\nalive. So three days before the Japanese\\ntook the island, your 22-year old\\ngrandfather asked a gunner on an Air Force\\ntransport named Winocki, a man he had\\nnever met before in his life, to deliver\\nto his infant son, who he had never seen\\nin the flesh, his gold watch. Three days\\nlater, your grandfather was dead. But\\nWinocki kept his word. After the war was\\nover, he paid a visit to your grandmother,\\ndelivering to your infant father, his\\nDad\\'s gold watch. This watch. This watch\\nwas on your Daddy\\'s wrist when he was shot\\ndown over Hanoi. He was captured and put\\nin a Vietnamese prison camp. Now he knew\\nif the gooks ever saw the watch it\\'s be\\nconfiscated. The way your Daddy looked at\\nit, that watch was your birthright. And\\nhe\\'d be damned if and slopeheads were\\ngonna put their greasy yella hands on his\\nboy\\'s birthright. So he hid it in the one\\nplace he knew he could hide somethin\\'. His\\nass. Five long years, he wore this watch\\nup his ass. Then when he died of\\ndisentary, he gave me the watch. I hid\\nwith uncomfortable hunk of metal up my ass\\nfor two years. Then, after seven years, I\\nwas sent home to my family. And now,\\nlittle man, I give the watch to you.\\nCapt. Koons hands the watch to Butch.

Now I\\nknow he\\'s dead, do you wanna know how I\\nfeel about it?\\nEsmarelda nods her head: \"yes.\"\\nBUTCH\\nI don\\'t feel the least little bit bad.\\nEXT. PHONE BOOTH (RAINING) – NIGHT\\nWe DOLLY around a phone booth as Butch talks inside.\\nBUTCH\\n(into phone)\\nWhat\\'s I tell ya, soon as the word got out\\na fix was in, the odds would be outta\\ncontrol. Hey, if he was a better fighter\\nhe\\'s be alive. If he never laced up his\\ngloves in the first place, which he never\\nshoulda done, he\\'d be alive. Enough about\\nthe poor unfortunate Mr. Floyd, let\\'s talk\\nabout the rich and prosperous Mr. Butch.\\nHow many bookies you spread it around\\nwith?\\n(pause)\\nEight? How long to collect?\\n(pause)\\nSo by tomorrow evening, you\\'ll have it\\nall?\\n(pause)\\nGood news Scotty, real good news – I\\nunderstand a few stragglers aside. Me an\\'\\nFabienne\\'re gonna leave in the morning. It\\nshould take us a couple days to get into\\nKnoxville. Next time we see each other,\\nit\\'ll be on Tennessee time.\\nButch hangs up the phone. He looks at the cab waiting to take him\\nwherever he wants to go.\\nBUTCH\\n(to himself in French with English\\nsubtitles)\\nFabienne my love, our adventure begins.}\\nCUT TO:\\nEXT. MOTEL (STOPPED / RAINING) – NIGHT\\nEsmeralda\\'s taxi pulled into the motel parking lot. The rain has\\nstopped, but the night is still soaked. Butch gets out, now fully\\ndressed in tee-shirt, jeans and high school athletic jacket. He\\nleans in the driver\\'s side window.\\nESMARELDA\\nForty-five sixty.\\nHanding her the money.\\nBUTCH\\nMerci beaucoup. And here\\'s a little\\nsomething for the effort.\\nButch holds up a hundred dollar bill.\\nEsmarelda\\'s eyes light up. She goes to take it. Butch holds it out\\nof reach.\\nBUTCH\\nNow if anybody should ask you about who\\nyour fare was tonight, what\\'re you gonna\\ntell \\'em?\\nESMARELDA\\nThe truth. Three well-dressed, slightly\\ntoasted, Mexicans.\\nHe gives her the bill.\\nBUTCH\\nBon soir, Esmarelda.\\nESMARELDA\\n(in Spanish)\\nSleep well, Butch.\\nHe tweaks her nose, she smiles, and he turns and walks away. She\\ndrives off.\\nINT. MOTEL (ROOM SIX) – NIGHT\\nButch enters and turns on the light.\\nLying curled up on the bed, fully dressed, with her back to us is\\nButch\\'s French girlfriend, FABIENNE.\\nFABIENNE\\nKeep the light off.\\nButch flicks the switch back, making the room dark again.\\nBUTCH\\nIs that better, sugar pop?}\\nFABIENNE\\nOui. Hard day at the office?\\nBUTCH\\nPretty hard. I got into a fight.\\nFABIENNE\\nPoor baby. Can we make spoons?\\nButch climbs into bed, spooning Fabienne from behind.\\nWhen Butch and Fabienne speak to each other, they speak in baby-\\ntalk.\\nFABIENNE\\nI was looking at myself in the mirror.\\nBUTCH\\nUh-huh?\\nFABIENNE\\nI wish I had a pot.\\nBUTCH\\nYou were lookin\\' in the mirror and you\\nwish you had some pot?\\nFABIENNE\\nA pot. A pot belly. Pot bellies are sexy.\\nBUTCH\\nWell you should be happy, \\'cause you do.\\nFABIENNE\\nShut up, Fatso! I don\\'t have a pot! I have\\na bit of a tummy, like Madonna when she\\ndid \"Lucky Star,\" it\\'s not the same thing.\\nBUTCH\\nI didn\\'t realize there was a difference\\nbetween a tummy and a pot belly.\\nFABIENNE\\nThe difference is huge.\\nBUTCH\\nYou want me to have a pot?\\nFABIENNE\\nNo. Pot bellies make a man look either\\noafish, or like a gorilla. But on a woman,\\na pot belly is very sexy. The rest of you\\nis normal. Normal face, normal legs,\\nnormal hips, normal ass, but with a big,\\nperfectly round pot belly. If I had one,\\nI\\'d wear a tee-shirt two sizes too small\\nto accentuate it.\\nBUTCH\\nYou think guys would find that attractive?}\\nFABIENNE\\nI don\\'t give a damn what men find\\nattractive. It\\'s unfortunate what we find\\npleasing to the touch and pleasing to the\\neye is seldom the same.\\nBUTCH\\nIf I had a pot belly, I\\'d punch you in it.\\nFABIENNE\\nYou\\'d punch me in my belly?\\nBUTCH\\nRight in the belly.\\nFABIENNE\\nI\\'d smother you. I\\'d drop it on your right\\non your face \\'til you couldn\\'t breathe.\\nBUTCH\\nYou\\'d do that to me?\\nFABIENNE\\nYes!\\nBUTCH\\nDid you get everything, sugar pop?\\nFABIENNE\\nYes, I did.\\nBUTCH\\nGood job.\\nFABIENNE\\nDid everything go as planned?\\nBUTCH\\nYou didn\\'t listen to the radio?\\nFABIENNE\\nI never listen to your fights. Were you\\nthe winner?\\nBUTCH\\nI won alright.\\nFABIENNE\\nAre you still retiring?\\nBUTCH\\nSure am.\\nFABIENNE\\nWhat about the man you fought?\\nBUTCH\\nFloyd retired too.}\\nFABIENNE\\n(smiling)\\nReally?! He won\\'t be fighting no more?!\\nBUTCH\\nNot no more.\\nFABIENNE\\nSo it all worked out in the finish?\\nBUTCH\\nWe ain\\'t at the finish, baby.\\nFabienne rolls over and Butch gets on top of her. They kiss.\\nFABIENNE\\nWe\\'re in a lot of danger, aren\\'t we?\\nButch nods his head: \"yes.\"\\nFABIENNE\\nIf they find us, they\\'ll kill us, won\\'t\\nthey?\\nButch nods his head: \"yes.\"\\nFABIENNE\\nBut they won\\'t find us, will they?\\nButch nods his head: \"no.\"\\nFABIENNE\\nDo you still want me to go with you?\\nButch nods his head: \"yes.\"\\nFABIENNE\\nI don\\'t want to be a burden or a nuisance\\n–\\nButch\\'s hand goes out of frame and starts massaging her crotch.\\nFabienne reacts.\\nFABIENNE\\nSay it!\\nBUTCH\\nFabienne, I want you to be with me.\\nFABIENNE\\nForever?\\nBUTCH\\n... and ever.\\nFabienne lies her head back.\\nButch continues to massage her crotch.}\\nFABIENNE\\nDo you love me?\\nBUTCH\\nOui.\\nFABIENNE\\nButch? Will you give me oral pleasure?\\nButch kisses her on the mouth.\\nBUTCH\\nWill you kiss it?\\nShe nods her head: \"yes.\"\\nFABIENNE\\nBut you first.\\nButch\\'s head goes down out of frame to carry out the oral\\npleasure. Fabienne\\'s face is alone in the frame.\\nFABIENNE\\n(in French, with English\\nsubtitles)\\nButch my love, the adventure begins.\\nFADE TO BLACK\\nFADE UP:\\nMOTEL ROOM\\nSame motel room, except empty. WE HEAR THE SHOWER RUNNING in the\\nbathroom. The CAMERA MOVES to the bathroom doorway. We see\\nFabienne in a white terry cloth robe that seems to swallow her up.\\nShe\\'s drying her head with a towel. Butch is inside the shower\\nwashing up. We see the outline of his naked body through the smoky\\nglass of the shower door. Steam fills the bathroom. Butch turns\\nthe shower off and opens the door, popping his head out.\\nBUTCH\\nI think I cracked a rib.\\nFABIENNE\\nGiving me oral pleasure?\\nBUTCH\\nNo retard, from the fight.\\nFABIENNE\\nDon\\'t call me retard.\\nBUTCH\\n(in a Mongoloid voice)\\nMy name is Fabby! My name is Fabby!}\\nFABIENNE\\nShut up fuck head! I hate that Mongoloid\\nvoice.\\nBUTCH\\nOkay, sorry, sorry, sorry, I take it back!\\nCan I have a towel please, Miss Beautiful\\nTulip.\\nFABIENNE\\nOh I like that, I like being called a\\ntulip. Tulip is much better than\\nMongoloid.\\nShe finishes drying her hair and wraps the towel like a turban on\\nher head.\\nBUTCH\\nI didn\\'t call you a Mongoloid, I called\\nyou a retard, but I took it back.\\nShe hands him a towel.\\nBUTCH\\nMerci beaucoup.\\nFABIENNE\\nButch?\\nBUTCH\\n(drying his head)\\nYes, lemon pie.\\nFABIENNE\\nWhere are we going to go?\\nBUTCH\\nI\\'m not sure yet. Wherever you want. We\\'re\\ngonna get a lot of money from this. But it\\nain\\'t gonna be so much, we can live like\\nhogs in the fat house forever. I was\\nthinking we could go somewhere in the\\nSouth Pacific. The kinda money we\\'ll\\nhave\\'ll carry us a long way down there.\\nFABIENNE\\nSo if we wanted, we could live in Bora\\nBora?\\nBUTCH\\nYou betcha. And if after awhile you don\\'t\\ndig Bora Bora, then we can move over to\\nTahiti or Mexico.\\nFABIENNE\\nBut I do not speak Spanish.}\\nBUTCH\\nYou don\\'t speak Bora Boran either.\\nBesides, Mexican is easy: Donde esta el\\nzapataria?\\nFABIENNE\\nWhat does that mean?\\nBUTCH\\nWhere\\'s the shoe store?\\nFABIENNE\\nDonde esta el zapataria?\\nBUTCH\\nExcellent pronunciation. You\\'ll be my\\nlittle mama ceta in no time.\\nButch exits the bathroom. We stay on Fabienne as she brushes her\\nteeth.\\nButch keeps on from the other room.\\nBUTCH (O.S.)\\nQue hora es?\\nFABIENNE\\nQue hora es?\\nBUTCH (O.S.)\\nWhat time is it?\\nFABIENNE\\nWhat time is it?\\nBUTCH (O.S.)\\nTime for bed. Sweet dream, jellybean.\\nFabienne brushes her teeth. We watch her for a moment or two, then\\nshe remember something.\\nFABIENNE\\nButch.\\nShe walks out of the bathroom to ask Butch a question, only to\\nfind him sound asleep in bed.\\nShe looks at him for a moment.\\nFABIENNE\\nForget it.\\nShe exits frame, going back in the bathroom. WE STAY on the WIDE\\nSHOT of the unconscious Butch in bed.\\nFADE TO BLACK\\nFADE UP:}\\nMOTEL ROOM – MORNING\\nSAME SHOT AS BEFORE, the next morning. We find Butch still asleep\\nin bed.\\nFabienne brushes her teeth half in and half out of the bathroom so\\nshe can watch TV at the same time. She still wears the terry cloth\\nrobe from the night before.\\nON TV: WILLIAM SMITH and a BUNCH OF HELL\\'S ANGELS are taking on\\nthe entire Vietnamese army in the film \"THE LOSERS\".\\nButch wakes from his sleep, as if a scary monster was chasing him.\\nHis start startles Fabienne.\\nFABIENNE\\nMerde! You startled me. Did you have a bad\\ndream?\\nButch squints down the front of the bed at her, trying to focus.\\nButch, still trying to chase the cobwebs away, sees on TV Hell\\'s\\nAngels tear-assin\\' through a Vietnamese prison camp.\\nBUTCH\\nWhat are you watching?\\nFABIENNE\\nA motorcycle movie, I\\'m not sure the name.\\nBUTCH\\nAre you watchin\\' it?\\nFabienne enters the room.\\nFABIENNE\\nIn a way. Why? Would you like for me to\\nswitch it off?\\nBUTCH\\nWould you please?\\nShe reaches over and turns off the TV.\\nBUTCH\\nIt\\'s a little too early in the morning for\\nexplosions and war.\\nFABIENNE\\nWhat was it about?\\nBUTCH\\nHow should I know, you were the one\\nwatchin\\' it.\\nFabienne laughs.\\nFABIENNE\\nNo, imbecile, what was your dream about?}\\nBUTCH\\nOh, I... don\\'t remember. It\\'s really rare\\nI remember a dream.\\nFABIENNE\\nYou just woke up from it.\\nBUTCH\\nFabienne, I\\'m not lying to you, I don\\'t\\nremember.\\nFABIENNE\\nWell, let\\'s look at the grumpy man in the\\nmorning. I didn\\'t say you were lying, it\\'s\\njust odd you don\\'t remember your dreams. I\\nalways remember mine. Did you know you\\ntalk in your sleep?\\nBUTCH\\nI don\\'t talk in my sleep, do I talk in my\\nsleep?\\nFABIENNE\\nYou did last night.\\nBUTCH\\nWhat did I say?\\nLaying on top of him.\\nFABIENNE\\nI don\\'t know. I couldn\\'t understand you.\\nShe kisses Butch.\\nFABIENNE\\nWhy don\\'t you get up and we\\'ll get some\\nbreakfast at that breakfast place with the\\npancakes.\\nBUTCH\\nOne more kiss and I\\'ll get up.\\nFabienne gives Butch a sweet long kiss.\\nFABIENNE\\nSatisfied?\\nBUTCH\\nYep.\\nFABIENNE\\nThen get up, lazy bones.\\nButch climbs out of bed and starts pulling clothes out of the\\nsuitcase that Fabienne brought.\\nBUTCH\\nWhat time is it?}\\nFABIENNE\\nAlmost nine in the morning. What time does\\nour train arrive?\\nBUTCH\\nEleven.\\nFABIENNE\\nI\\'m gonna order a big plate of blueberry\\npancakes with maple syrup, eggs over easy,\\nand five sausages.\\nBUTCH\\n(surprised at her potential appetite)\\nAnything to drink with that?\\nButch is finished dressing.\\nFABIENNE\\n(referring to his clothes)\\nOh yes, that looks nice. To drink, a tall\\nglass or orange juice and a black cup of\\ncoffee. After that, I\\'m going to have a\\nslice of pie.\\nAs he goes through the suitcase.\\nBUTCH\\nPie for breakfast?\\nFABIENNE\\nAny time of the day is a good time for\\npie. Blueberry pie to go with the\\npancakes. And on top, a thin slice of\\nmelted cheese –\\nBUTCH\\n– where\\'s my watch?\\nFABIENNE\\nIt\\'s there.\\nBUTCH\\nNo, it\\'s not. It\\'s not here.\\nFABIENNE\\nHave you looked?\\nBy now, Butch is frantically rummaging through the suitcase.\\nBUTCH\\nYes I\\'ve fuckin\\' looked!!\\nHe\\'s now throwing clothes.\\nBUTCH\\nWhat the fuck do you think I\\'m doing?! Are\\nyou sure you got it?\\nFabienne can hardly speak, she\\'s never seen Butch this way.}\\nFABIENNE\\nUhhh... yes... beside the table drawer –\\nBUTCH\\n– on the little kangaroo.\\nFABIENNE\\nYes, it was on your little kangaroo.\\nBUTCH\\nWell it\\'s not here!\\nFABIENNE\\n(on the verge of tears)\\nWell it should be!\\nBUTCH\\nOh it most definitely should be here, but\\nit\\'s not. So where is it?\\nFabienne is crying and scared.\\nButch lowers his voice, which only serves to make him more\\nmenacing.\\nBUTCH\\nFabienne, that was my father\\'s fuckin\\'\\nwatch. You know what my father went\\nthrough to git me that watch?... I don\\'t\\nwanna get into it right now... but he went\\nthrough a lot. Now all this other shit,\\nyou coulda set on fire, but I specifically\\nreminded you not to forget my father\\'s\\nwatch. Now think, did you get it?\\nFABIENNE\\nI believe so...\\nBUTCH\\nYou believe so? You either did, or you\\ndidn\\'t, now which one is it?\\nFABIENNE\\nThen I did.\\nBUTCH\\nAre you sure?\\nFABIENNE\\n(shaking)\\nNo.\\nButch freaks out, he punches the air.\\nFabienne SCREAMS and backs into a corner,\\nButch picks up the motel TV and THROWS IT AGAINST the wall.\\nFabienne SCREAMS IN HORROR.}\\nButch looks toward her, suddenly calm.\\nBUTCH\\n(to Fabienne)\\nNo! It\\'s not your fault.\\n(he approached her)\\nYou left it at the apartment.\\nHe bends down in front of the woman who has sunk to the floor.\\nHe touches her hand, she flinches.\\nBUTCH\\nIf you did leave it at the apartment, it\\'s\\nnot your fault. I had you bring a bunch of\\nstuff. I reminded you about it, but I\\ndidn\\'t illustrate how personal the watch\\nwas to me. If all I gave a fuck about was\\nmy watch, I should\\'ve told you. You ain\\'t\\na mind reader.\\nHe kisses her hand. Then rises.\\nFabienne is still sniffling.\\nButch goes to the closet.\\nFABIENNE\\nI\\'m sorry.\\nButch puts on his high school jacket.\\nBUTCH\\nDon\\'t be. It just means I won\\'t be able to\\neat breakfast with you.\\nFABIENNE\\nWhy does it mean that?\\nBUTCH\\nBecause I\\'m going back to my apartment to\\nget my watch.\\nFABIENNE\\nWon\\'t the gangsters be looking for you\\nthere?\\nBUTCH\\nThat\\'s what I\\'m gonna find out. If they\\nare, and I don\\'t think I can handle it,\\nI\\'ll split.\\nRising from the floor.\\nFABIENNE\\nI was so dreadful. I saw your watch, I\\nthought I brought it. I\\'m so sorry.\\nButch brings her close and puts his hands on her face.}\\nBUTCH\\nDon\\'t feel bad, sugar pop. Nothing you\\ncould ever do would make me permanently\\nangry at you.\\n(pause)\\nI love you, remember?\\n(he digs some money out of\\nhis wallet)\\nNow here\\'s some money, order those\\npancakes and have a great breakfast.\\nFABIENNE\\nDon\\'t go.\\nBUTCH\\nI\\'ll be back before you can say, blueberry\\npie.\\nFABIENNE\\nBlueberry pie.\\nBUTCH\\nWell maybe not that fast, but fast. Okay?\\nOkay?\\nFABIENNE\\nOkay.\\nHe kisses her once more and heads for the door.\\nBUTCH\\nBye-bye, sugar pop.\\nFABIENNE\\nBye.\\nBUTCH\\nI\\'m gonna take your Honda.\\nFABIENNE\\nOkay.\\nAnd with that, he\\'s out the door.\\nFabienne sits on the bed and looks at the money he gave her.\\nINT. HONDA (MOVING) – DAY\\nButch is beating the steering wheel and the dash with his fists as\\nhe drives down the street.\\nBUTCH\\nOf all the fuckin\\' things she coulda\\nforgot, she forgets my father\\'s watch. I\\nspecifically reminded her not to forget\\nit. \"Bedside table – on the kangaroo.\" I\\nsaid the words: \"Don\\'t forget my father\\'s\\nwatch.\"}\\nEXT. CITY STREET – DAY\\nThe little Honda races toward its destination as fast as is little\\nengine will take it.\\nCUT TO:\\nA parking meter red flag rises up, then out, leaving the arrow\\npointing at one hour.\\nEXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET CORNER – DAY\\nButch isn\\'t completely reckless. He has parked his car a couple of\\nblocks from his apartment to check things out before he goes\\nboppin\\' through the front door.\\nEXT. ALLEY – DAY\\nButch walks down the alley until he gets to another street, then\\nhe discreetly glances out.\\nEXT. STREET – BUTCH\\'S APARTMENT – DAY\\nEverything seems normal. More or less the right number of cars in\\nthe street. None of the parked cars appear out of place. None of\\nthem have a couple of goons sitting inside. Basically, it looks\\nlike normal morning activity in front of Butch\\'s home.\\nButch peers around a wall, taking in the vital information.\\nButch walks out of the alley and is ready for anything. He crosses\\nthe street and enters his apartment courtyard.\\nAcross the street from Butch\\'s building, on the corner, is a\\ncombination donut shop and Japanese restaurant. A big sign sticks\\nup in the air, with the name \"Teriyaki Donut\" and a graphic of a\\ndonut sticking out of a bowl of rice.\\nEXT. BUTCH\\'S APARTMENT COURTYARD – DAY\\nButch is in the courtyard of his North Hollywood apartment\\nbuilding. Once again, everything appears normal – the laundry\\nroom, the pool, his apartment door – nothing appears disturbed.\\nButch climbs the stairs leading to his apartment, number 12. He\\nsteps outside the door and listens inside. Nothing.\\nButch slowly inserts the key into the door, quietly opening it.\\nINT. BUTCH\\'S APARTMENT – DAY\\nHis apartment hasn\\'t been touched.}\\nHe cautiously steps inside, shuts the door and takes a quick look\\naround. Obviously, no one is there.\\nButch walks into his modest kitchen, and opens the refrigerator.\\nHe takes out a carton of milk and drinks from\\nit.\\nWith carton in hard, Butch surveys the apartment. Then he goes to\\nthe bedroom.\\nHis bedroom is like the rest of the apartment – neat, clean and\\nanonymous. The only things personal in his room are a few boxing\\ntrophies, an Olympic silver medal, a framed issue of \"Ring\\nMagazine\" with Butch on the cover, and a poster of Jerry Quarry\\nand one of George Chuvalo.\\nSure enough, there\\'s the watch just like he said it was: On the\\nbedside table, hanging on his little kangaroo statue.\\nHe walks through the apartment and back into the kitchen. He opens\\na cupboard and takes out a box of Pop Tarts. Putting down the\\nmilk, he opens the box, takes out two Pop Tarts and puts them in\\nthe toaster.\\nButch glances to his right, his eyes fall on something.\\nWhat he sees is a small compact Czech M61 submachine gun with a\\nhuge silencer on it, lying on his kitchen counter.\\nBUTCH\\n(softly)\\nHoly shit.\\nHe picks up the intimidating peace of weaponary and examines it.\\nThen... a toilet FLUSHES.\\nButch looks up to the bathroom door, which is parallel to the\\nkitchen. There is someone behind it.\\nLike a rabbit caught in a radish patch, Butch freezes, not knowing\\nwhat to do.\\nThe bathroom door opens and Vincent Vega steps out of  the\\nbathroom, tightening his belt. In his hand is the book \"MODESTY\\nBLAISE\" by Peter O\\'Donnell.\\nVincent and Butch lock eyes.\\nVincent freezes.\\nButch doesn\\'t move, except to point the M61 in Vincent\\'s\\ndirection.\\nNeither man opens his mouth.\\nThen... the toaster LOUDLY kicks up the Pop Tarts.\\nThat\\'s all the situation needed.}\\nButch\\'s finger HITS the trigger.\\nMUFFLED FIRE SHOOTS out of the end of the gun.\\nVincent is seemingly WRACKED with twenty bullets SIMULTANEOUSLY –\\nLIFTING him off his feet, PROPELLING him through the air and\\nCRASHING through the glass shower door at the end of the bathroom.\\nBy the time Butch removes his finger from the trigger, Vincent is\\nannihilated.\\nButch stands frozen, amazed at what just happened. His look goes\\nfrom the grease spot in the bathroom that was once Vincent, down\\nto the powerful piece of artillery in his grip.\\nWith the respect it deserves, Butch carefully places the M61 back\\non the kitchen counter.\\nThen he exits the apartment, quickly.\\nEXT. APARTMENT COURTYARD – DAY\\nButch, not running, but walking very rapidly, crosses the\\ncourtyard...\\n... comes out of the apartment building, crosses the street...\\n... goes through the alley...\\n... and into his car in one STEADICAM SHOT.\\nEXT. HONDA – DAY\\nButch CRANKS the car into gear and drives away. The big wide smile\\nof a survivor breaks across his face.\\nEXT. APARTMENT BUILDING STREET – DAY\\nThe Honda turns down the alley and slowly cruises by his apartment\\nbuilding.\\nINT. HONDA – DAY\\nButch looks out the window at his former home.\\nBUTCH\\nThat\\'s how you\\'re gonna beat \\'em, Butch.\\nThey keep underestimatin\\' ya.\\nThis makes the boxer laugh out loud. As he laughs, he flips a tape\\nin the cassette player. When the MUSIC starts, he SINGS along with\\nit.\\nHe drives by the apartment, but is stopped at the light on the\\ncorner across from Teriyaki Donut.}\\nButch is still chuckling, singing along with the song, as we see:\\nTHROUGH THE WINDSHIELD\\nThe big man himself, Marsellus Wallace, exit Teriyaki Donut,\\ncarrying a box of a dozen donuts and two large styrofoam cups of\\ncoffee. He steps off the curb, crossing the street in front of\\nButch\\'s car. This is the first time we see Marsellus clearly.\\nLaughing boy stops when he sees the big man directly in front of\\nhim.\\nWhen Marsellus is in front of Butch\\'s car, he casually glances to\\nhis left, sees Butch, continues walking... then STOPS!\\nDOUBLE-TAKE: \"Am I really seeing what I\\'m seeing?\"\\nButch doesn\\'t wait for the big man to answer his own question. He\\nSTOMPS on the gas pedal.\\nThe little Honda SLAMS into Marsellus, sending him, the donuts and\\nthe coffee HITTING the pavement at thirty miles an hour.\\nButch CUTS into cross traffic and is BROAD-SIDED by a gold Camaro\\nZ-28, BREAKING all the windows in the Honda and sending it up on\\nthe sidewalk.\\nButch sits dazed and confused in the crumpled mess of what at one\\ntime was Fabienne\\'s Honda. Blood flows from his nostrils. The\\nstill-functional tape player continues to play. A PEDESTRIAN pokes\\nhis head inside.\\nPEDESTRIAN\\nJesus, are you okay?\\nButch look at him, spaced-out.\\nBUTCH\\nI guess.\\nMarsellus Wallace lies sprawled out in the street. GAWKERS gather\\naround the body.\\nGAWKER #1\\n(to the others)\\nHe\\'s dead! He\\'s dead!\\nThis jerk\\'s yelling makes Marsellus come to.\\nTWO PEDESTRIANS help the shaken Butch out of the wreckage.\\nThe woozy Marsellus gets to his feet.\\nGAWKER #2\\nIf you need a witness in court, I\\'ll be\\nglad to help. He was a drunken maniac. He\\nhit you and crashed into that car.}\\nMARSELLUS\\n(still incoherent)\\nWho?\\nGAWKER #2\\n(pointing at Butch)\\nHim.\\nMarsellus follows the Gawker\\'s finger and sees Butch Coolidge down\\nthe street, looking a shambles.\\nMARSELLUS\\nWell, I\\'ll be damned.\\nThe big man takes out a .45 Automatic and the Gawkers back away.\\nMarsellus starts moving toward Butch.\\nButch sees the fierce figure making a wobbly bee-line toward him.\\nBUTCH\\nSacre bleu.\\nMarsellus brings up his weapon and FIRES, but he\\'s so hurt, shaky\\nand dazed that his arm goes wild.\\nHe HITS a LOOKY-LOO WOMAN in the hip. She falls to the ground,\\nscreaming.\\nLOOKY-LOO WOMAN\\nOh my God, I\\'ve been shot!\\nThat\\'s all Butch needs to see. He\\'s outta here.\\nMarsellus RUNS after him.\\nThe CROWD looks agape.\\nButch is in a mad, limping RUN.\\nThe big man\\'s hot on his ass with a cockeyed wobbly run.\\nButch cuts across traffic and dashes into a business with a sign\\nthat reads \"MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP\".\\nINT. MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP – DAY\\nMAYNARD, a hillbilly-lookin\\' boy, stands behind the counter of his\\npawnshop when, all of a sudden, chaos in the form of Butch RACES\\ninto his world.\\nMAYNARD\\nCan I help you wit\\' somethin\\'?\\nBUTCH\\nShut up!\\nButch quickly takes measure of the situation, than stands next to\\nthe door.}\\nMAYNARD\\nNow you just wait one goddamn minute –\\nBefore Maynard can finish his threat, Marsellus CHARGES in. He\\ndoesn\\'t get past the doorway  because Butch LANDS his fist in\\nMarsellus\\' face.\\nThe gangster\\'s feet go out from under him and the big man FALLS\\nFLAT on his back.\\nOutside, two police cars with their SIRENS BLARING race by.\\nButch POUNCES on the fallen body, PUNCHING him twice more in the\\nface.\\nButch takes the gun out of Marsellus\\' hand, than grabs ahold of\\nhis middle finger.\\nBUTCH\\nSo you like chasing people, huh?\\nHe BREAKS the finger. Marsellus lets out a pain sound.Butch then\\nplaces the barrel of the .45 between his eyes, PULLS back the\\nhammer and places his open hand behind the gun to shield the\\nsplatter.\\nBUTCH\\nWell guess what, big man, you caught me –\\nMAYNARD (O.S.)\\n– hold it right there, godammit!\\nButch and Marsellus look up at Maynard, who\\'s brandishing a pump-\\naction shotgun, aimed at the two men.\\nBUTCH\\nLook mister, this ain\\'t any of your\\nbusiness –\\nMAYNARD\\n– I\\'m makin\\' it my business! Now toss that\\ngun!\\nButch does.\\nMAYNARD\\nNow you on top, stand up and come to the\\ncounter.\\nButch slowly gets up and moves to the counter. As soon as he gets\\nthere, Maynard HAULS OFF, HITTING him hard in the face with the\\nbutt of the shotgun, knocking Butch down and out.\\nAfter Butch goes down, Maynard calmly lays the shotgun on the\\ncounter and moves to the telephone.\\nMarsellus Wallace, from his position on the floor, groggily\\nwatches the pawnshop owner dial a number. Maynard waits on the\\nline while the other end rings. Then it picks up.}\\nMAYNARD\\nZed? It\\'s Maynard. The spider just caught\\na coupl\\'a flies.\\nMarsellus passes out.\\nFADE TO BLACK\\nFADE UP:\\nINT. PAWNSHOP BACK ROOM – DAY\\nTWO SHOT – BUTCH AND MARSELLUS\\nThey are tied up in two separate chairs. In their mouths are two\\nS&M-style ball gags (a belt goes around their heads and a little\\nred ball sticks in their mouths). Both men are unconscious.\\nMaynard steps in with a fire extinguisher and SPRAYS both guys\\nuntil they\\'re wide awake and wet as otters. The two prisoners look\\nup at their captors.\\nMaynard stands in front of them, fire extinguisher in one hand,\\nshotgun in the other, and Marsellus\\' .45 sticking in his belt.\\nMAYNARD\\nNobody kills anybody in my place of\\nbusiness except me or Zed.\\nA BUZZER buzzes.\\nMAYNARD\\nThat\\'s Zed.\\nWithout saying another word, Maynard climbs up the stairs that\\nlead to red curtains and goes through them.\\nWE HEAR, on the other side of the curtains, Maynard let Zed inside\\nthe store.\\nButch and Marsellus look around the room. The basement of the\\npawnshop has been converted into a dungeon. After taking in their\\npredicament, Butxh and Marsellus look at each other, all traces of\\nhostility gone, replaced by a terror they both share at what\\nthey\\'ve gotten themselves into.\\nMaynard and ZED come through the curtains. Zed is an even more\\nintense version of Maynard, if such a thing is possible. The two\\nhillbillys are obviously brothers. Where Maynard is a vicious\\npitbull, Zed is a deadly cobra. Zed walks in and stands in front\\nof the two captives. He inspects them for a long time, then says:\\nZED\\n(to Maynard)\\nYou said you waited for me?\\nMAYNARD\\nI did.}\\nZED\\nThen how come they\\'re all beat up?\\nMAYNARD\\nThey did that to each other. They was\\nfightin\\' when they came in. This one was\\ngonna shoot that one.\\nZED\\n(to Butch)\\nYou were gonna shoot him?\\nButch makes no reply.\\nZED\\nHey, is Grace gonna be okay in front of\\nthis place?\\nMAYNARD\\nYeah, it ain\\'t Tuesday is it?\\nZED\\nNo, it\\'s Thursday.\\nMAYNARD\\nThen she\\'ll be fine.\\nZED\\nBring out The Gimp.\\nMAYNARD\\nI think The Gimp\\'s sleepin\\'.\\nZED\\nWell, I guess you\\'ll just wake \\'em up\\nthen, won\\'t you?\\nMaynard opens a trap door in the floor.\\nMAYNARD\\n(yelling in the hole)\\nWake up!\\nMaynard reaches into the hole and comes back holding onto a leash.\\nHe gives it a rough yank and, from below the floor, rises THE\\nGIMP.\\nThe Gimp is a man they keep dressed from head to toe in black\\nleather bondage gear. There are zippers, buckles and studs here\\nand there on the body. On his head is a black leather mask with\\ntwo eye holes and a zipper (closed) for a mouth. They keep him in\\na hole in the floor big enough for a large dog.\\nZed takes the chair, sits it in front of the two prisoners, then\\nlowers into it. Maynard hands The Gimp\\'s leash to Zed, then backs\\naway.\\nMAYNARD\\n(to The Gimp)\\nDown!}\\nThe Gimp gets on its knees.\\nMaynard hangs back while Zed appraises the two men.\\nMAYNARD\\nWho\\'s first?\\nZED\\nI ain\\'t fer sure yet.\\nThen with his little finger, Zed does a silent \"Eenie, meany,\\nminey, moe... \" just his mouth mouthing the words and his finger\\ngoing back and forth between the two.\\nButch are Marsellus are terrified.\\nMaynard looks back and forth at the victims.\\nThe Gimps\\'s eyes go from one to the other inside the mask.\\nZed continues his silent sing-song with his finger moving left to\\nright, then it stops.\\nTWO SHOT – BUTCH AND MARSELLUS\\nAfter a beat, THE CAMERA MOVES to the right, zeroing in on\\nMarsellus.\\nZed stands up.\\nZED\\nWanna do it here?\\nMAYNARD\\nNaw, drag big boy to Russell\\'s old room.\\nZed grabs Marsellus\\' chair and DRAGS him into Russell\\'s old room.\\nRussell, no doubt, was some other poor bastard that has the\\nmisfortune of stumbling into the Mason-Dixie pawnshop. Whatever\\nhappened to Russell is known only to Maynard and Zed because his\\nold room, a back room in the back of the back room, is empty.\\nAs Marsellus is dragged away, he locks eyes with Butch before he\\ndisappears behind the door of Russell\\'s old room.\\nMAYNARD\\n(to The Gimp)\\nUp!\\nThe Gimp rises. Maynard ties The Gimp\\'s leash to a hook on the\\nceiling.\\nMAYNARD\\nKeep an eye on this one.\\nThe Gimp bows its head: \"yes.\"Maynard disappears into Russell\\'s\\nold room. There must be a stereo in there because suddenly The\\nJudds, singing in harmony, fills the air.}\\nButch looks at The Gimp. The Gimp giggles from underneath the mask\\nas if this were the funniest moment in the history of comedy.\\nFrom behind the door we hear country MUSIC, struggling, and:\\nMAYNARD (O.S.)\\nWhoa, this boy\\'s got a bit of fight in\\n\\'em!\\nWe the HEAR Maynard and Zed beat on Marsellus.\\nZED (O.S.)\\nYou wanna fight? You wanna fight? Good, I\\nlike to fight!\\nButch pauses, listens to the voices. Then, in a panic, hurriedly\\nstruggles to get free.\\nThe Gimp is laughing wildly.\\nThe ropes are on too tight and Butch can\\'t break free.\\nThe Gimp slaps his knee laughing\\nIn the back room, we hear:\\nMAYNARD (O.S.)\\nThat\\'s it... that\\'s it boy, you\\'re goin\\'\\nfine. Oooooooh, just like that... that\\'s\\ngood.\\n(grunting faster)\\nStay still... stay still goddamn ya! Zed\\ngoddammit, git over here and hold \\'em!\\nButch stops struggling and lifts up on his arms. Then, quite\\neasily, the padded chair back slides up and off as if it were\\nnever connected by a bolt.\\nThe Gimp sees this and its eyes widen.\\nTHE GIMP\\nHuhng?\\nThe Gimp FLAILS WILDLY, trying to get the leash off the hook. He\\ntries to yell, but all that comes out are excited gurgles and\\ngrunts.\\nButch is out of his chair, quickly dispensing three BOXER\\'S\\nPUNCHES to its face. The punches knock The Gimp out, making him\\nfall to his knees, this HANGING HIMSELF by the leash attached to\\nthe hook,\\nButch removes the ball gag, then silently makes his way through\\nthe red curtains.}\\nINT. PAWNSHOP – DAY\\nButch sneaks to the door.\\nOn the counter is a big set of keys with a large Z connected to\\nthe ring. Grabbing them, he\\'s about to go out when he stops and\\nlistens to the hillbilly psychopaths having their way with\\nMarsellus.\\nButch decides for the life of him, he can\\'t leave anybody in a\\nsituation like that. Se he begins rooting around the pawnshop for\\na weapon to bash those hillbillies\\' heads in with.\\nHe picks up a big destructive-looking hammer, then discards it:\\nNot destructive enough. He picks up a chainsaw, thinks about it\\nfor a moment, then puts it back. Next, a large Louisville slugger\\nhe tries on for size. But then he spots what he\\'s been looking\\nfor:\\nA Samurai sword.\\nIt hands in its hand-carved wood sheath from a nail on the wall,\\nnext to a neon \"DAD\\'S OLD-FASHIONED ROOT BEER\" sign. Butch takes\\nthe sword off the wall, removing it from ist sheath. It\\'s a\\nmagnificent piece of steel. It seems to glisten in the low-wattage\\nlight of the pawnshop. Butch touches his thumb to the blade to see\\nif the sword is just for show. Not on your life. It\\'s as sharp as\\nit gets. This weapon seems made to order for the Brothers Grimm\\ndownstairs. Holding the sword pointed downward, Takakura Ken-\\nstyle, he disappears through the red curtains to take care of\\nbusiness.\\nINT. PAWNSHOP BACK ROOM – DAY\\nButch quietly sneaks down the stairs leading to the dungeon.\\nSodomy and the Judds can still be heard going string behind the\\nclosed door that leads to Russell\\'s old room.\\nINT. RUSSELL\\'S OLD ROOM – DAY\\nButch\\'s hand comes into frame, pushing the door open. It swings\\nopen silently, revealing the rapists, who have switched positions.\\nZed is now bent over Marsellus, who is bent over a wooden horse.\\nMaynard watches. Both have their backs to Butch.\\nMaynard faces the CAMERA, grinning, while Butch comes up behind\\nhim with the sword.\\nMiserable, violated, and looking like a rag doll, Marsellus, red\\nball gag still in mouth, opens his watery eyes to see Butch coming\\nup behind Maynard. His eyes widen.\\nBUTCH\\nHey hillbilly.\\nMaynard turns and sees Butch holding the sword.}\\nButch SCREAMS... with one mighty SWING, SLASHES Maynard across the\\nfront, moving past him, eyes and blade now locked on Zed.\\nMaynard stands trembling, his front sliced open, in shock.\\nButch, while never taking his eyes off Zed, THRUSTS the sword\\nbehind him, SKEWERING Maynard, then EXTRACTS it, pointing the\\nblade toward Zed. Maynard COLLAPSES.\\nZed disengages from Marsellus in a hurry and his eyes go from the\\ntip of Butch\\'s sword to Marsellus\\' .45 Automatic, which lies\\nwithin reach.\\nButch\\'s eyes follow Zed\\'s.\\nBUTCH\\nYou want that gun, Zed? Pick it up.\\nZed\\'s hand inches toward the weapon.\\nButch GRIPS the sword tighter.\\nZed studies Butch.\\nButch looks hard at Zed.\\nThen a VOICE says:\\nMARSELLUS (O.S.)\\nStep aside, Butch.\\nButch steps aside, REVEALING Marsellus standing behind him,\\nholding Maynard\\'s pump-action shotgun.\\nKABOOM!!!!\\nZed is BLASTED in the groin. Down he goes, SCREAMING in AGONY.\\nMarsellus, looking down at his whimpering rapist, EJECTS the used\\nshotgun shell.\\nButch lowers the sword and hangs back. Not a word, until:\\nBUTCH\\nYou okay?\\nMARSELLUS\\nNaw man. I\\'m pretty fuckin\\' far from okay!\\nLong pause.\\nBUTCH\\nWhat now?}\\nMARSELLUS\\nWhat now? Well let me tell you what now.\\nI\\'m gonna call a couple pipe-hittin\\'\\nniggers, who\\'ll go to work on homes here\\nwith a pair of pliers and a blow torch.\\n(to Zed)\\nHear me talkin\\' hillbilly boy?! I ain\\'t\\nthrough with you by a damn sight. I\\'m\\ngonna git Medieval on your ass.\\nBUTCH\\nI meant what now, between me and you?\\nMARSELLUS\\nOh, that what now? Well, let me tell ya\\nwhat now between me an\\' you. There is no\\nme an\\' you. Not no more.\\nBUTCH\\nSo we\\'re cool?\\nMARSELLUS\\nYeah man, we\\'re cool. One thing I ask –\\ntwo things I ask: Don\\'t tell nobody about\\nthis. This shit\\'s between me and you and\\nthe soon-to-be-livin\\'-the-rest-of-his-\\nshort-ass-life-in-agonizing-pain, Mr.\\nRapist here. It ain\\'t nobody else\\'s\\nbusiness. Two: leave town. Tonight. Right\\nnow. And when you\\'re gone, stay gone.\\nYou\\'ve lost your Los Angeles privileges.\\nDeal?\\nBUTCH\\nDeal.\\nThe two men shake hands, then hug one another.\\nMARSELLUS\\nGo on now, get your ass outta here.\\nButch leaves Russell\\'s old room through the red curtains.\\nMarsellus walks over to a phone, dialing a number.\\nMARSELLUS\\n(into the phone)\\nHello Mr. Wolf, it\\'s Marsellus. Gotta bit\\nof a situation.\\nEXT. MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP – DAY\\nButch, still shaking in his boots, exits the pawnshop. He looks\\nahead and sees, parked in front of the establishment, Zed\\'s Big\\nChrome Chopper with a teardrop gas tank that has the name \"GRACE\"\\non it. He climbs aboard, takes out the keys with the big Z on them\\nand starts up the huge hog. It RUMBLES to life, making sounds like\\na rocket fighting for orbit. Butch twists the accelerator handle\\nand SPEEDS off.}\\nWE CUT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN...\\nINT.

Then a look of confusion crosses\\nhis face.\\nTWO SHOT – JULES AND VINCENT\\nStanding next to each other, unharmed. Amazing as it seems, none\\nof the Fourth Man\\'s shots appear to have hit anybody. Jules and\\nVincent exchange looks like, \"Are we hit?\" They\\'re as confused at\\nthe shooter.

We SEE a crap game being played on a fancy crap\\ntable by GAMBLERS in tuxedos and LUCKY LADIES in fancy evening\\ngowns. The CAMERA PANS to the right revealing: Sitting on a bed,\\nphone in hand with his back to us, the tuxedo-clad WINSTON WOLF\\naka \"THE WOLF\". We also see The Wolf has a small notepad that he\\njots details\\nin.\\nTHE WOLF\\n(into phone)\\nIs she the hysterical type?\\n(pause)\\nWhen she due?\\n(jotting down)\\nGive me the principals\\' names again?\\n(jots down)\\nJules...\\nWe SEE his book. The page has written on it:\\n\"1265 Riverside Drive\\nToluca Lake\\n1 body (no head)\\nBloody shot-up car\\nJules (black)\"\\nTHE WOLF\\n... Vincent... Jimmie... Bonnie...\\nHe writes:\\n\"Vincent (Dean Martin)\\nJimmie (house)\\nBonnie (9:30)\"\\nTHE WOLF\\nExpect a call around 10:30. It\\'s about\\nthirty minutes away. I\\'ll be there in ten.\\nHe hangs up. We never see his face.\\nCUT TO:\\nTITLE CARD OVER BLACK:\\n\"NINE MINUTES AND THIRTY-SEVEN SECONDS LATER\"\\nCUT TO:\\nEXT. JIMMIE\\'S STREET – MORNING\\nA silver Porsche WHIPS the corner leading to Jimmie\\'s home, in\\nHYPER DRIVE. Easily doing 135 mph, the Porsche stops on a dime in\\nfront of Jimmie\\'s house.}\\nA ringed finger touches the doorbell: DING DONG.\\nINT. JIMMIE\\'S HOUSE – MORNING\\nJimmie opens the door. We see, standing in the doorway, the\\ntuxedo-clad man. He looks down to his notebook, then up at Jimmie.\\nTHE WOLF\\nYou\\'re Jimmie, right? This is your house?\\nJIMMIE\\nYeah.\\nTHE WOLF\\n(stick his hand out)\\nI\\'m Winston Wolf, I solve problems.\\nJIMMIE\\nGood, \\'cause we got one.\\nTHE WOLF\\nSo I heard. May I come in?\\nJIMMIE\\nPlease do.\\nIn the dining room, Jules and Vincent stand up.\\nTHE WOLF\\nYou must be Jules, which would make you\\nVincent. Let\\'s get down to brass tacks,\\ngentlemen. If I was informed correctly,\\nthe clock is ticking, is that right,\\nJimmie?\\nJIMMIE\\n100%.\\nTHE WOLF\\nYour wife, Bonnie...\\n(refers to his pad)\\n... comes home at 9:30 in the AM, is that\\ncorrect?\\nJIMMIE\\nUh-huh.\\nTHE WOLF\\nI was led to believe if she comes home and\\nfinds us here, she wouldn\\'t appreciate it\\nnone too much.\\nJIMMIE\\nShe won\\'t at that.}\\nTHE WOLF\\nThat give use forty minutes to get the\\nfuck outta Dodge, which, if you do what I\\nsay when I say it, should by plenty. Now\\nyou got a corpse in a car, minus a head,\\nin a garage. Take me to it.\\nINT. JIMMIE\\'S GARAGE – MORNING\\nThe three men hand back as The Wolf examines the car. He studies\\nthe car in silence, opening the door, looking inside, circling it.\\nTHE WOLF\\nJimmie?\\nJIMMIE\\nYes.\\nTHE WOLF\\nDo me a favor, will ya? Thought I smelled\\nsome coffee in there. Would you make me a\\ncup?\\nJIMMIE\\nSure, how do you take it?\\nTHE WOLF\\nLotsa cream, lotsa sugar.\\nJimmie exists. The Wolf continues his examination.\\nTHE WOLF\\nAbout the car, is there anything I need to\\nknow? Does it stall, does it make a lot of\\nnoise, does it smoke, is there gas in it,\\nanything?\\nJULES\\nAside from how it looks, the car\\'s cool.\\nTHE WOLF\\nPositive? Don\\'t get me out on the road and\\nI find out the brake lights don\\'t work.\\nJULES\\nHey man, as far as I know, the\\nmotherfucker\\'s tip-top.\\nTHE WOLF\\nGood enough, let\\'s go back to the kitchen.\\nINT. KITCHEN – MORNING\\nJimmie hands The Wolf a cup of coffee.\\nTHE WOLF\\nThank you, Jimmie.}\\nHe takes a sip, then, pacing as he thinks, lays out for the three\\nmen the plan of action.\\nTHE WOLF\\nOkay first thing, you two.\\n(meaning Jules and Vincent)\\nTake the body, stick it in the trunk. Now\\nJimmie, this looks to be a pretty\\ndomesticated house. That would lead me to\\nbelieve that in the garage or under the\\nsink, you got a bunch of cleaners and\\ncleaners and shit like that, am I correct?\\nJIMMIE\\nYeah. Exactly. Under the sink.\\nTHE WOLF\\nGood. What I need you two fellas to do is\\ntake those cleaning products and clean the\\ninside of the car. And I\\'m talkin\\' fast,\\nfast, fast. You need to go in the\\nbackseat, scoop up all those little pieces\\nof brain and skull. Get it out of there.\\nWipe down the upholstery – now when it\\ncomes to upholstery, it don\\'t need to be\\nspic and span, you don\\'t need to eat off\\nin. Give it a good once over. What you\\nneed to take care of are the really messy\\nparts. The pools of blood that have\\ncollected, you gotta soak that shit up.\\nBut the windows are a different story.\\nThem you really clean. Get the Windex, do\\na good job. Now Jimmie, we need to raid\\nyour linen closet. I need blankets, I need\\ncomforters, I need quilts, I need\\nbedspreads. The thicker the better, the\\ndarker the better. No whites, can\\'t use\\n\\'em. We need to camouflage the interior of\\nthe car. We\\'re gonna line the front seat\\nand the backseat and the floor boards with\\nquilts and blankets. If a cop stops us and\\nstarts stickin\\' his big snout in the car,\\nthe subterfuge won\\'t last. But at a\\nglance, the car will appear to be normal.\\nJimmie – lead the way, boys – get to work.\\nThe Wolf and Jimmie turn, heading for the bedroom, leaving Vincent\\nand Jules standing in the kitchen.\\nVINCENT\\n(calling after him)\\nA \"please\" would be nice.\\nThe Wolf stops and turns around.\\nTHE WOLF\\nCome again?\\nVINCENT\\nI said a \"please\" would be nice.}\\nThe Wolf takes a step toward him.\\nTHE WOLF\\nSet is straight, Buster. I\\'m not here to\\nsay \"please.\"I\\'m here to tell you want to\\ndo. And if self-preservation is an\\ninstinct you possess, you better fuckin\\'\\ndo it and do it quick. I\\'m here to help.\\nIf my help\\'s not appreciated, lotsa luck\\ngentlemen.\\nJULES\\nIt ain\\'t that way, Mr. Wolf. Your help is\\ndefinitely appreciated.\\nVINCENT\\nI don\\'t mean any disrespect. I just don\\'t\\nlike people barkin\\' orders at me.\\nTHE WOLF\\nIf I\\'m curt with you, it\\'s because time is\\na factor. I think fast, I talk fast, and I\\nneed you guys to act fast if you want to\\nget out of this. So pretty please, with\\nsugar on top, clean the fuckin\\' car.\\nINT. JIMMIE\\'S BEDROOM – MORNING\\nJimmie\\'s gathering all the bedspreads, quilts and linen he has.\\nThe Wolf is on the phone.\\nTHE WOLF\\n(into phone)\\nIt\\'s a 1974 Chevy Nova.\\n(pause)\\nWhite.\\n(pause)\\nNothin\\', except for the mess inside.\\n(pause)\\nAbout twenty minutes.\\n(pause)\\nNobody who\\'ll be missed.\\n(pause)\\nYou\\'re a good man, Joe. See ya soon.\\n(he looks at Jimmie)\\nHow we comin\\', Jimmie?\\nJimmie comes over with a handful of linen.\\nJIMMIE\\nMr. Wolf, you gotta understand somethin\\' –\\nTHE WOLF\\n– Winston, Jimmie – please, Winston.}\\nJIMMIE\\nYou gotta understand something, Winston. I\\nwant to help you guys out and all, but\\nthat\\'s my best linen. It was a wedding\\npresent from my Uncle Conrad and Aunt\\nGinny, and they ain\\'t with us anymore –\\nTHE WOLF\\n– let me ask you a question, if you don\\'t\\nmind?\\nJIMMIE\\nSure.\\nTHE WOLF\\nWere you Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny\\nmillionaires?\\nJIMMIE\\nNo.\\nTHE WOLF\\nWell, your Uncle Marsellus is. And I\\'m\\npositive if Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny\\nwere millionaires, they would\\'ve furnished\\nyou with a whole bedroom set, which your\\nUncle Marsellus is more than happy to do.\\n(takes out a roll of bills)\\nI like oak myself, that\\'s what\\'s in my\\nbedroom. How \\'bout you Jimmie, you an oak\\nman?\\nJIMMIE\\nOak\\'s nice.\\nINT. GARAGE – MORNING\\nBoth Jules and Vincent are inside the car cleaning it up. Vincent\\nis in the front seat washing windows, while Jules is in the\\nbackseat, picking up little pieces of skull and gobs of brain.\\nBoth are twice as bloody as they were before.\\nJULES\\nI will never forgive your ass for this\\nshit. This is some fucked-up repugnant\\nshit!\\nVINCENT\\nDid you ever hear the philosophy that once\\na man admits he\\'s wrong, he\\'s immediately\\nforgiven for all wrong-doings?\\nJULES\\nMan, get outta my face with that shit! The\\nmotherfucker who said that never had to\\npick up itty-bitty pieces of skull with\\nhis fingers on account of your dumb ass.}\\nVINCENT\\nI got a threshold, Jules. I got a\\nthreshold for the abuse I\\'ll take. And\\nyou\\'re crossin\\' it. I\\'m a race car and you\\ngot me in the red. Redline 7000, that\\'s\\nwhere you are. Just know, it\\'s fuckin\\'\\ndangerous to be drivin\\' a race car when\\nit\\'s in the red. It could blow.\\nJULES\\nYou\\'re gettin\\' ready to blow? I\\'m a\\nmushroom-cloud-layin\\' motherfucker! Every\\ntime my fingers touch brain I\\'m \"SUPERFLY\\nT.N.T,\" I\\'m the \"GUNS OF NAVARONE.\" I\\'m\\nwhat Jimmie Walker usta talk about. In\\nfact, what the fuck am I doin\\' in the\\nback? You\\'re the motherfucker should be on\\nbrain detail. We\\'re tradin\\'. I\\'m washin\\'\\nwindows and you\\'re pickin\\' up this\\nnigger\\'s skull.\\nINT. CHEVY NOVA – MORNING\\nThe interior of the car has been cleaned and lined with bedspreads\\nand quilts. Believe it or not, what looked like a portable\\nslaughterhouse can actually pass for a non-descript vehicle.\\nThe Wolf circles the car examining it.\\nJules and Vincent stand aside, their clothes are literally a\\nbloody mess, but they do have a sense of pride in what a good job\\nthey\\'ve done.\\nTHE WOLF\\nFine job, gentlemen. We may get out of\\nthis yet.\\nJIMMIE\\nI can\\'t believe that\\'s the same car.\\nTHE WOLF\\nWell, let\\'s not start suckin\\' each other\\'s\\ndicks quite yet. Phase one is complete,\\nclean the car, which moves us right along\\nto phase two, clean you two.\\nEXT. JIMMIE\\'S BACKYARD – MORNING\\nJules and Vincent stand side by side in their black suits, covered\\nin blood, in Jimmie\\'s backyard.

Yes, strippin\\' off those\\nbloody rags is absolutely necessary. Toss\\nthe clothes in Jim\\'s garbage bag.\\nJULES\\nNow Jimmie, don\\'t do nothin\\' stupid like\\nputtin\\' that out in front of your house\\nfor Elmo the garbage man\\nto take away.\\nTHE WOLF\\nDon\\'t worry, we\\'re takin\\' it with us. Jim,\\nthe soap.\\nHe hands the now-naked men a bar of soap.\\nTHE WOLF\\nOkay gentlemen, you\\'re both been to County\\nbefore, I\\'m sure. Here it comes.\\nHe hits the trigger, water SHOOTS OUT, SMACKING both men.\\nJULES\\nGoddamn, that water\\'s fuckin\\' cold!\\nTHE WOLF\\nBetter you than me, gentlemen.\\nThe two men, trembling, scrub themselves.\\nTHE WOLF\\nDon\\'t be afraid of the soap, spread it\\naround.\\nThe Wolf stops the hose, tossing it on the ground.}\\nTHE WOLF\\nTowel \\'em.\\nJimmie tosses them each a towel, which they rub furiously across\\ntheir bodies.\\nTHE WOLF\\nYou\\'re dry enough, give \\'em their clothes.\\nFADE UP ON:\\nJULES ANDVINCENT\\nIn their tee-shirts and swim trunks. They look a million miles\\naway from the black-suited, bad-asses we first met.\\nTHE WOLF\\nPerfect. Perfect. We couldn\\'t\\'ve planned\\nthis better. You guys look like... what do\\nthey look like, Jimmie?\\nJIMMIE\\nDorks. They look like a couple of dorks.\\nThe Wolf and Jimmie laugh.\\nJULES\\nHa ha ha.

Don\\'t make me\\nbeg.\\nINT. JIMMIE\\'S GARAGE – MORNING\\nThe garbage bag is tossed in the car trunk on top of Marvin. The\\nWolf SLAMS is closed.}\\nTHE WOLF\\nGentlemen, let\\'s get our rules of the road\\nstraight. We\\'re going to a place called\\nMonster Joe\\'s Truck and Tow. Monster Joe\\nand his daughter Raquel are sympathetic to\\nout dilemma. The place is North Hollywood,\\nso a few twist and turns aside, we\\'ll be\\ngoin\\' up Hollywood Way. Now I\\'ll drive the\\ntainted car. Jules, you ride with me.\\nVincent, you follow in my Porsche. Now if\\nwe cross the path of any John Q.

My gun just went off,\\nI dunno how.\\nTHE WOLF\\nFair enough.\\n(he throws Vince his car keys)\\nI drive real fuckin\\' fast, so keep up. If\\nI get my car back any different than I\\ngave it, Monster Joe\\'s gonna be disposing\\nof two bodies.\\nEXT.

Respect. You\\ncould lean a lot from those two fine\\nspecimens. Respect for one\\'s elders shows\\ncharacter.}\\nRAQUEL\\nI have character.\\nWINSTON\\nJust because you are a character doesn\\'t\\nmean you have character.\\nRAQUEL\\nOh you\\'re so funny, oh you\\'re so funny.\\nThe Porsche SHOOTS OFF down the road.\\nThe two men left alone look at each other.\\nJULES\\nWanna share a cab?\\nVINCENT\\nYou know I could go for some breakfast.\\nWhat to have breakfast with me?\\nJULES\\nSure.\\nINT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING\\nJules and Vincent sit at a booth. In front of Vincent is a big\\nstack of pancakes and sausages, which he eats with gusto. Jules,\\non the other hand, just has a cup of coffee and a muffin. He seems\\nfar away in thought. The Waitress pours a refill for both men,\\nVINCENT\\nThanks a bunch.\\n(to Jules, who\\'s nursing his coffee)\\nWant a sausage?\\nJULES\\nNaw, I don\\'t eat pork.\\nVINCENT\\nAre you Jewish?\\nJULES\\nI ain\\'t Jewish man, I just don\\'t dig on\\nswine.\\nVINCENT\\nWhy not?\\nJULES\\nThey\\'re filthy animals. I don\\'t eat filthy\\nanimals.\\nVINCENT\\nSausages taste good. Pork chops taste\\ngood.}\\nJULES\\nA sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie.\\nI\\'ll never know \\'cause even if it did, I\\nwouldn\\'t eat the filthy motherfucker. Pigs\\nsleep and root in shit. That\\'s a filthy\\nanimal. I don\\'t wanna eat nothin\\' that\\nain\\'t got enough sense to disregard its\\nown feces.\\nVINCENT\\nHow about dogs? Dogs eat their own feces.\\nJULES\\nI don\\'t eat dog either.\\nVINCENT\\nYes, but do you consider a dog to be a\\nfilthy animal?\\nJULES\\nI wouldn\\'t go so far as to call a dog\\nfilthy, but they\\'re definitely dirty. But\\na dog\\'s got personality. And  personality\\ngoes a long way.\\nVINCENT\\nSo by that rationale, if a pig had a\\nbetter personality, he\\'s cease to be a\\nfilthy animal?\\nJULES\\nWe\\'d have to be talkin\\' \\'bout one\\nmotherfuckin\\' charmin\\' pig. It\\'d have to\\nbe the Cary Grant of pigs.\\nThe two men laugh.\\nVINCENT\\nGood for you. Lighten up a little. You\\nbeen sittin\\' there all quiet.\\nJULES\\nI just been sittin\\' here thinkin\\'.\\nVINCENT\\n(mouthful of food)\\nAbout what?\\nJULES\\nThe miracle we witnessed.\\nVINCENT\\nThe miracle you witnessed. I witnessed a\\nfreak occurrence.\\nJULES\\nDo you know that a miracle is?\\nVINCENT\\nAn act of God.}\\nJULES\\nWhat\\'s an act of God?\\nVINCENT\\nI guess it\\'s when God makes the impossible\\npossible. And I\\'m sorry Jules, but I don\\'t\\nthink what happened this morning\\nqualifies.\\nJULES\\nDon\\'t you see, Vince, that shit don\\'t\\nmatter. You\\'re judging this thing the\\nwrong way. It\\'s not about what. It could\\nbe God stopped the bullets, he changed\\nCoke into Pepsi, he found my fuckin\\' car\\nkeys. You don\\'t judge shit like this based\\non merit. Whether or not what we\\nexperienced was an according-to-Hoyle\\nmiracle is insignificant. What is\\nsignificant is I felt God\\'s touch, God got\\ninvolved.\\nVINCENT\\nBut why?\\nJULES\\nThat\\'s what\\'s fuckin\\' wit\\' me! I don\\'t\\nknow why. But I can\\'t go back to sleep.\\nVINCENT\\nSo you\\'re serious, you\\'re really gonna\\nquit?\\nJULES\\nThe life, most definitely.\\nVincent takes a bite of food. Jules takes a sip of coffee In the\\nb.g., we see a PATRON call the Waitress.\\nPATRON\\nGarcon! Coffee!\\nWe recognize the patron to be Pumpkin from the first scene of\\nPumpkin and Honey Bunny.\\nVINCENT\\nSo if you\\'re quitting the life, what\\'ll\\nyou do?\\nJULES\\nThat\\'s what I\\'ve been sitting here\\ncontemplating. First, I\\'m gonna deliver\\nthis case to Marsellus. Then, basically,\\nI\\'m gonna walk the earth.\\nVINCENT\\nWhat do you mean, walk the earth?}\\nJULES\\nYou know, like Caine in \"KUNG FU.\" Just\\nwalk from town to town, meet people, get\\nin adventures.\\nVINCENT\\nHow long do you intend to walk the earth?\\nJULES\\nUntil God puts me where he want me to be.\\nVINCENT\\nWhat if he never does?\\nJULES\\nIf it takes forever, I\\'ll wait forever.\\nVINCENT\\nSo you decided to be a bum?\\nJULES\\nI\\'ll just be Jules, Vincent – no more, no\\nless.\\nVINCENT\\nNo Jules, you\\'re gonna be like those\\npieces of shit out there who beg for\\nchange. They walk around like a bunch of\\nfuckin\\' zombies, they sleep in garbage\\nbins, they eat what I throw away, and dogs\\npiss on \\'em. They got a word for \\'em,\\nthey\\'re called bums. And without a job,\\nresidence, or legal tender, that\\'s what\\nyou\\'re gonna be – a fuckin\\' bum!\\nJULES\\nLook my friend, this is just where me and\\nyou differ –\\nVINCENT\\n– what happened was peculiar – no doubt\\nabout it – but it wasn\\'t water into wine.\\nJULES\\nAll shapes and sizes, Vince.\\nVINCENT\\nStop fuckin\\' talkin\\' like that!\\nJULES\\nIf you find my answers frightening,\\nVincent, you should cease askin\\' scary\\nquestions.\\nVINCENT\\nI gotta take a shit. To be continued.}\\nVincent exitsfor the restroom.\\nJules, alone, takes a mouthful of muffin, then... Pumpkin and\\nHoney Bunny rise with guns raised.\\nPUMPKIN\\nEverybody be cool, this is a robbery!\\nHONEY BUNNY\\nAny of you fuckin\\' pricks move and I\\'ll\\nexecute every one of you motherfuckers!\\nGot that?!\\nJules looks up, not believing what he\\'s seeing. Under the table,\\nJules\\' hand goes to his .45 Automatic. He pulls it out, COCKING\\nIT.\\nPUMPKIN\\nCustomers stay seated, waitresses on the\\nfloor.\\nHONEY BUNNY\\nNow mean fuckin\\' now! Do it or die, do it\\nor fucking die!\\nLike lightning, Pumpkin moves over to the kitchen. While Honey\\nBunny SCREAMS out threats to the PATRONS, keeping them terrified.\\nPUMPKIN\\nYou Mexicans in the kitchen, get out here!\\nAsta luego!\\nThree COOKS and two BUSBOYS come out of the kitchen.\\nPUMPKIN\\nOn the floor or I\\'ll cook you ass,\\ncomprende?\\nThey comprende. The portly MANAGER speaks up.\\nMANAGER\\nI\\'m the manager here, there\\'s no problem,\\nno problem at all –\\nPumpkin head his way.\\nPUMPKIN\\nYou\\'re gonna give me a problem?\\nHe reaches him and sticks the barrel of his gun hard in the\\nManager\\'s neck.\\nPUMPKIN\\nWhat? You said you\\'re gonna give me a\\nproblem?\\nMANAGER\\nNo, I\\'m not. I\\'m not gonna give you any\\nproblem!}\\nPUMPKIN\\nI don\\'t know, Honey Bunny. He looks like\\nthe hero type to me!\\nHONEY BUNNY\\nDon\\'t take any chances. Execute him!\\nThe Patrons SCREAM. Jules watches all this silently, his hand\\ntightly gripping the .45 Automatic under the table.\\nMANAGER\\nPlease don\\'t! I\\'m not a hero. I\\'m just a\\ncoffee shop manager. Take anything you\\nwant.\\nPUMPKIN\\nTell everyone to cooperate and it\\'ll be\\nall over.\\nMANAGER\\nEverybody just be calm and cooperate with\\nthem and this will be all over soon!\\nPUMPKIN\\nWell done, now git your fuckin\\' ass on the\\nground.\\nINT. COFFEE SHOP BATHROOM – MORNING\\nVincent, on the toilet, oblivious to the pandemonium outside,\\nreads his \"MODESTY BLAISE\" book.\\nINT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING\\nCash register drawer opens. Pumpkin stuffs the money from the till\\nin his pocket. Then walks from behind the counter with a trash bag\\nin his hand.\\nPUMPKIN\\nOkay people, I\\'m going to go \\'round and\\ncollect your wallets. Don\\'t talk, just\\ntoss \\'em in the bag. We clear?\\nPumpkin goes around collecting wallets. Jules sits with his .45\\nready to spit under the table.\\nPumpkin sees Jules sitting in his booth, holding his wallet,\\nbriefcase next to him. Pumpkin crosses to him, his tone more\\nrespectful, him manner more on guard.\\nPUMPKIN\\nIn the bag.\\nJules DROPS his wallet in the bag. Using his gun as a pointer,\\nPumpkin points to the briefcase.\\nPUMPKIN\\nWhat\\'s in that?}\\nJULES\\nMy boss\\' dirty laundry.\\nPUMPKIN\\nYou boss makes you do his laundry?\\nJULES\\nWhen he wants it clean.\\nPUMPKIN\\nSounds like a shit job.\\nJULES\\nFunny, I\\'ve been thinkin\\' the same thing.\\nPUMPKIN\\nOpen it up.\\nJules\\' free hand lays palm flat on the briefcase.\\nJULES\\n\\'Fraid I can\\'t do that.\\nPumpkin is definitely surprised by his answer. He aims the gun\\nright in the middle of Jules\\' face and pulls back the hammer.\\nPUMPKIN\\nI didn\\'t hear you.\\nJULES\\nYes, you did.\\nThis exchange has been kind of quiet, not everybody heard it, but\\nHoney Bunny senses something\\'s wrong.\\nHONEY BUNNY\\nWhat\\'s goin\\' on?\\nPUMPKIN\\nLooks like we got a vigilante in our\\nmidst.\\nHONEY BUNNY\\nShoot \\'em in the face!\\nJULES\\nI don\\'t mean to shatter your ego, but this\\nain\\'t the first time I\\'ve had gun pointed\\nat me.\\nPUMPKIN\\nYou don\\'t open up that case, it\\'s gonna be\\nthe last.\\nMANAGER\\n(on the ground)\\nQuit causing problems, you\\'ll get us all\\nkilled! Give \\'em what you got and get \\'em\\nout of here.}\\nJULES\\nKeep your fuckin\\' mouth closed, fat man,\\nthis ain\\'t any of your goddamn business!\\nPUMPKIN\\nI\\'m countin\\' to three, and if your hand\\nain\\'t off that case, I\\'m gonna unload\\nright in your fuckin\\' face. Clear? One...\\nPUMPKIN\\n... two... three.\\nJULES\\nYou win.\\nJules raises his hand off the briefcase.\\nJULES\\nIt\\'s all yours, Ringo.\\nPUMPKIN\\nOpen it.\\nJules flips the locks and opens the case, revealing it to Pumpkin\\nbut not to us. The same light SHINES from the case. Pumpkin\\'s\\nexpression goes to amazement. Honey Bunny, across the room, can\\'t\\nsee shit.\\nHONEY BUNNY\\nWhat is it? What is it?\\nPUMPKIN\\n(softly)\\nIs that what I think it is?\\nJules nods his head: \"yes.\"\\nPUMPKIN\\nIt\\'s beautiful.\\nJules nods his head: \"yes.\"\\nHONEY BUNNY\\nGoddammit, what is it?\\nJules SLAMS the case closed, then sits back, as if offering the\\ncase to Pumpkin. Pumpkin, one big smile, bends over to pick up the\\ncase.\\nLike a rattlesnake, Jules\\' free hand GRABS the wrist of Pumpkin\\'s\\ngun hand, SLAMMING it on the table. His other hand comes from\\nunder the table and STICKS the barrel of his .45 hand under\\nPumpkin\\'s chin.\\nHoney Bunny freaks out, waving his gun in Jules\\' direction.}\\nHONEY BUNNY\\nLet him go!

Now I\\ndon\\'t want that and you don\\'t want that\\nand Ringo here don\\'t want that. So let\\'s\\nsee what we can do.\\n(to Ringo)\\nNow this is the situation. Normally both\\nof your asses would be dead as fuckin\\'\\nfried chicken. But you  appened to pull\\nthis shit while I\\'m in a transitional\\nperiod. I don\\'t wanna kill ya, I want to\\nhelp ya.

UNCLE BOB\\'S PANCAKE HOUSE - MORNING 1 1\\nEight men dressed in BLACK SUITS, sit around a table at a \\nbreakfast cafe.  They are MR. WHITE, MR. PINK, MR. BLUE,\\nMR. BLONDE, MR. ORANGE, MR. BROWN, NICE GUY EDDIE CABOT,and the big boss, JOE CABOT.  Most are finished eating and \\nare enjoying coffee and conversation.  Joe flips through a small address book.  Mr. Pink is telling a long and involved story about Madonna.\\nMR. PINK\\n\"Like a Virgin\" is all about a girl who digs a guy with a big dick.  The whole song is a metaphor for big dicks.\\nMR. BLUE\\nNo it\\'s not.  It\\'s about a girl who is very vulnerable and she\\'s been fucked over a few times. Then she meets some guy who\\'s really sensitive--\\nMR. PINK\\n--Whoa...whoa...time out Greenbay. Tell that bullshit to the tourists.\\nJOE\\n(looking through his \\naddress book)\\nToby...who the fuck is Toby? Toby...Toby...think...think... think...\\nMR. PINK\\nIt\\'s not about a nice girl who meets a sensitive boy.  Now granted that\\'s what \"True Blue\" is about, no argument about that.\\nMR. ORANGE\\nWhich one is \"True Blue?\"\\nNICE GUY EDDIE\\nYou don\\'t remember \"True Blue?\" That was a big ass hit for Madonna.  Shit, I don\\'t even follow this Tops In Pops shit, and I\\'ve at least heard of \"True Blue.\"}\\nMR. ORANGE\\nLook, asshole, I didn\\'t say I ain\\'t \\nheard of it.  All I asked was how does it go?  Excuse me for not being the world\\'s biggest Madonna fan.\\nMR. BROWN\\nI hate Madonna.\\nMR. BLUE\\nI like her early stuff.  You know, \"Lucky Star,\" \"Borderline\" - but once she got into her \"Papa Don\\'t Preach\" phase, I don\\'t know, I tuned out.\\nMR. PINK\\nHey, fuck all that, I\\'m making a point here.  You\\'re gonna make me lose my train of thought.\\nJOE\\nOh fuck, Toby\\'s that little china girl.\\nMR. WHITE\\nWhat\\'s that?\\nJOE\\nI found this old address book in a jacket I ain\\'t worn in a coon\\'s age.  Toby what?  What the fuck was her last name?\\nMR. PINK\\nWhere was I?\\nMR. ORANGE\\nYou said \"True Blue\" was about a nice girl who finds a sensitive fella.  But \"Like a Virgin\" was a metaphor for big dicks.\\nMR. PINK\\nLet me tell ya what \"Like a Virgin\"\\'s about.  It\\'s about some cooze who\\'s a regular fuck machine.\\nI mean all the time, morning, day, night, afternoon, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick.\\nMR. BLUE\\nHow many dicks was that?2.}\\nMR. WHITE\\nA lot.\\nMR. PINK\\nThen one day she meets a John \\nHolmes motherfucker, and it\\'s like, whoa baby.  This mother fucker\\'s like Charles Bronson in \"The Great Escape.\"  He\\'s diggin tunnels.  Now she\\'s gettin this serious dick action, she\\'s feelin something she ain\\'t felt since forever.  Pain.\\nJOE\\nChew?  Toby Chew?  No.\\nMR. PINK\\nIt hurts.  It hurts her.  It shouldn\\'t hurt.  Her pussy should be Bubble-Yum by now.  But when this cat fucks her, it hurts.  It hurts like the first time.  The pain is reminding a fuck machine what is was like to be a virgin. Hence, \"Like a Virgin.\"\\nThe fellas crack up.\\nJOE\\nWong?\\nMR. PINK\\nFuck you, wrong.  I\\'m right!  What the fuck do you know about it anyway?  You\\'re still listening to Jerry-fucking-Vale.\\nJOE\\nNot wrong, dumb ass, Wong!  You know, like the Chinese name?\\nMr. White snatches the address book from Joe\\'s hand.  They fight, but they\\'re not really mad at each other.\\nMR. WHITE\\nGive me this fucking thing.\\nJOE\\nWhat the fuck do you think you\\'re doin?  Give me my book back!\\nMR. WHITE\\nI\\'m sick of fuckin hearin it Joe, I\\'ll give it back when we leave.3.}\\nJOE\\nWhaddaya mean, give it to me when \\nwe leave, give it back now.\\nMR. WHITE\\nFor the past fifteen minutes now, you\\'ve just been droning on with names.  \"Toby...Toby...Toby... Toby Wong...Toby Wong...Toby Chung...fuckin Charlie Chan.\"  I got Madonna\\'s big dick outta my right ear, and Toby Jap I-don\\'t- know-what, outta my left.\\nJOE\\nWhat do you care?\\nMR. WHITE\\nWhen you\\'re annoying as hell, I care a lot.\\nJOE\\nGive me my book.\\nMR. WHITE\\nYou gonna put it away?\\nJOE\\nI\\'m gonna do whatever I wanna do with it.\\nMR. WHITE\\nWell, then, I\\'m afraid I\\'m gonna have to keep it.\\nMR. BLONDE\\nJoe, you want me to shoot him for you?\\nMR. WHITE\\nShit, you shoot me in a dream, you better wake up and apologize.\\nNICE GUY EDDIE\\nHave you guys been listening to K- BILLY\\'s super sounds of the seventies weekend?\\nMR. PINK\\nYeah, it\\'s fuckin great isn\\'t it?\\nNICE GUY EDDIE\\nCan you believe the songs they been playin?4.}\\nMR. PINK\\nNo, I can\\'t.  You know what I heard \\nthe other day?  \"Heartbeat - It\\'s Lovebeat,\" by little Tony DeFranco and the DeFranco Family. I haven\\'t heard that since I was in fifth fuckin grade.\\nNICE GUY EDDIE\\nWhen I was coming down here, I was playin it.  And \"The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia\" came on.  Now I ain\\'t heard that song since it was big, but when it was big, I heard it a million- trillion times.  I\\'m listening to it this morning, and this was the first time I ever realized that the lady singing the song, was the one who killed Andy.\\nMR. BLUE\\nYou didn\\'t know Vicki Lawrence killed the guy?\\nNICE GUY EDDIE\\nI thought the cheatin wife shot Andy.\\nMR. BLONDE\\nThey say it in the song.\\nNICE GUY EDDIE\\nI know, I heard it.  I musta zoned out whenever that part came on before.  I thought when she said that little sister stuff, she was talkin about her sister- in-law, the cheatin wife.\\nJOE\\nNo, she did it.  She killed the cheatin wife, too.\\nMR. PINK\\nYou know the part in \"Gypsies, Tramps and Theives,\" when she says \"Poppa woulda shot his if he knew what he\\'d done?\"  I could never figure out what he did.\\nThe table laughs.  The WAITRESS comes over to the table. She has the check, and a pot of coffee.5.}\\nWAITRESS\\nCan I get anybody more coffee.\\nJOE\\nNo, we\\'re gonna be hittin it. I\\'ll \\ntake care of the check.\\nShe hands the bill to him.\\nWAITRESS\\nHere ya go.  Please pay at the register, if you wouldn\\'t mind.\\nJOE\\nSure thing.\\nWAITRESS\\nYou guys have a wonderful day.\\nThey all mutter equivalents.  She exits and Joe stands up.\\nJOE\\nI\\'ll take care of this, you guys leave the tip.\\n(to Mr. White)\\nAnd when I come back, I want my book back.\\nMR. WHITE\\nSorry, it\\'s my book now.\\nJOE\\nBlonde, shoot this piece of shit, will ya?\\nMr. Blonde shoots Mr. White with his finger.  Mr White acts shot.  Joe exits.\\nNICE GUY EDDIE\\nOkay, everybody cough up green for the little lady.\\nEverybody whips out a buck, and throws it on the table. Everybody, that is, except Mr. White.\\nNICE GUY EDDIE (CONT’D)\\nC\\'mon, throw in a buck.\\nMR. WHITE\\nUh-uh.  I don\\'t tip.\\nNICE GUY EDDIE\\nWhaddaya mean you don\\'t tip?6.}\\nMR. WHITE\\nI don\\'t believe in it.\\nNICE GUY EDDIE\\nYou don\\'t believe in tipping?\\nMR. PINK\\n(laughing)\\nI love this kid, he\\'s a madman, \\nthis guy.\\nMR. BLONDE\\nDo you have any idea what these ladies make?  They make shit.\\nMR. WHITE\\nDon\\'t give me that.  She don\\'t make enough money, she can quit.\\nEverybody laughs.\\nNICE GUY EDDIE\\nI don\\'t even know a Jew who\\'d have the balls to say that.  So let\\'s get this straight. You never ever tip?\\nMR. WHITE\\nI don\\'t tip because society says I gotta.  I tip when somebody deserves a tip.  When somebody really puts forth an effort, they deserve a little something extra. But this tipping automatically, that shit\\'s for the birds.  As far as I\\'m concerned, they\\'re just doin their job.\\nMR. BLUE\\nOur girl was nice.\\nMR. WHITE\\nOur girl was okay.  She didn\\'t do anything special.\\nMR. BLONDE\\nWhat\\'s something special, take ya in the kitchen and suck your dick?\\nThey all laugh.\\nNICE GUY EDDIE\\nI\\'d go over twelve percent for that.7.}\\nMR. WRITE\\nLook, I ordered coffee.  Now we\\'ve \\nbeen here a long fuckin time, and she\\'s only filled my cup three times.  When I order coffee,  I want it filled six times.\\nMR. BLONDE\\nWhat if she\\'s too busy?\\nMR. WHITE\\nThe words \"too busy\" shouldn\\'t be in a waitress\\'s vocabulary.\\nNICE GUY EDDIE\\nExcuse me, Mr. White, but the last thing you need is another cup of coffee.\\nThey all laugh.\\nMR. WHITE\\nThese ladies aren\\'t starvin to death.  They make minimum wage. When I worked for minimum wage, I wasn\\'t lucky enough to have a job that society deemed tipworthy.\\nNICE GUY EDDIE\\nAhh, now we\\'re getting down to it. It\\'s not just that he\\'s a cheap bastard--\\nMR. ORANGE\\n--It is that too--\\nNICE GUY EDDIE\\n--It is that too.  But it\\'s also he couldn\\'t get a waiter job.  You talk like a pissed off dishwasher: \"Fuck those cunts and their fucking tips.\"\\nMR. BLONDE\\nSo you don\\'t care that they\\'re counting on your tip to live?\\nMr. White rubs two of his fingers together.\\nMR. WHITE\\nDo you know what this is?  It\\'s the world\\'s smallest violin, playing just for the waitresses.8.}\\nMR. BLONDE\\nYou don\\'t have any idea what you\\'re \\ntalking about.  These people bust their ass. This is a hard job.\\nMR. WHITE\\nSo\\'s working at McDonald\\'s, but you don\\'t feel the need to tip them.  They\\'re servin ya food, you should tip em.  But no, society says tip these guys over here, but not those guys over there.  That\\'s bullshit.\\nMR. ORANGE\\nThey work harder than the kids at McDonald\\'s.\\nMR. WHITE\\nOh yeah, I don\\'t see them cleaning fryers.\\nMR. BROWN\\nThese people are taxed on the tips they make.  When you stiff \\'em, you cost them money.\\nMR. BLONDE\\nWaitressing is the number one occupation for female non-college graduates in this country.  It\\'s the one jab basically any woman can get, and make a living on. The reason is because of tips.\\nMR. WHITE\\nFuck all that.\\nThey all laugh.\\nMR. WHITE (CONT’D)\\nHey, I\\'m very sorry that the government taxes their tips. That\\'s fucked up.  But that ain\\'t my fault.  it would appear that waitresses are just one of the many groups the government fucks in the ass on a regular basis. You show me a paper says the government shouldn\\'t do that, I\\'ll sign it.  Put it to a vote, I\\'ll vote for it.  But what I won\\'t do is play ball.  9.}\\nAnd this non- college bullshit \\nyou\\'re telling me, I got two words for that: \"Learn to fuckin type.\"  Cause if you\\'re expecting me to help out with the rent, you\\'re in for a big fuckin surprise.\\nMR. ORANGE\\nHe\\'s convinced me.  Give me my dollar back.\\nEverybody laughs.  Joe\\'s comes back to the table.\\nJOE\\nOkay ramblers, let\\'s get to rambling.  Wait a minute, who didn\\'t throw in?\\nMR. ORANGE\\nMr. White.\\nJOE\\n(to Mr. Orange)\\nMr. White?\\n(to Mr. White)\\nWhy?\\nMR. ORANGE\\nHe don\\'t tip.\\nJOE\\n(to Mr. Orange)\\nHe don\\'t tip?\\n(to Mr. White)\\nYou don\\'t tip?  Why?\\nMR. ORANGE\\nHe don\\'t believe in it.\\nJOE\\n(to Mr. Orange)\\nHe don\\'t believe in it?\\n(to Mr. White)\\nYou don\\'t believe in it?\\nMR. ORANGE\\nNope.\\nJOE\\n(to Mr. Orange)\\nShut up!\\n(to Mr. White)10.}\\nCough up the buck, ya cheap \\nbastard, I paid for your goddamn breakfast.\\nMR. WHITE\\nBecause you paid for the breakfast, I\\'m gonna tip. Normally I wouldn\\'t.\\nJOE\\nWhatever.  Just throw in your dollar, and let\\'s move.\\n(to Mr. Blonde)\\nSee what I\\'m dealing with here. Infants.  I\\'m fuckin dealin with infants.\\nThe eight men get up to leave.  Mr. White\\'s waist is in the F.G.  As he buttons his coat, for a second we see he\\'s carrying a gun.  They exit Uncle Bob\\'s Pancake House, talking amongst themselves.\\nEXT. UNCLE BOB\\'S PANCAKE HOUSE - DAY 2 2\\nCREDIT \\nSEQUENCE:\\nWhen the credit sequence is finished, we    FADE TO BLACK:Over the BLACK we hear the sound of SOMEONE SCREAMING in \\nagony.\\nUnder the screaming, we hear the sound of a car HAULING ASS, \\nthrough traffic.\\nOver the screams and the traffic noise, we hear SOMEBODY\\nELSE SAY:\\nSOMEBODY ELSE (OS)\\nJust hold on buddy boy.\\nSomebody stops screaming long enough to say:\\nSOMEBODY (OS)\\nI\\'m sorry.  I can\\'t believe she \\nkilled me.  Who would\\'ve fuckin thought that?\\nCUT TO:11.}\\nINT. GETAWAY GAR (MOVING) - DAY 3 3\\nThe Somebody screaming is Mr. Orange.  He lies in the \\nbackseat.  He\\'s been SHOT in the stomach.  BLOOD covers both him and the backseat.\\nMr. White is the Somebody Else.  He\\'s behind the wheel of \\nthe getaway car.  He\\'s easily doing 80 mph, dodging in and out of traffic.  Though he\\'s driving for his life, he keeps talking to his wounded passenger in the backseat.\\nThey are the only two in the car.\\nMR. WHITE\\nHey, just cancel that shit right \\nnow!  You\\'re hurt.  You\\'re hurt really fucking bad, but you ain\\'t dying.\\nMR. ORANGE\\n(crying)\\nAll this blood is scaring the shit outta me.  I\\'m gonna die, I know it.\\nMR. WHITE\\nOh excuse me, I didn\\'t realize you had a degree in medicine.  Are you a doctor?  Are you a doctor? Answer me please, are you a doctor?\\nMR. ORANGE\\nNo, I\\'m not!\\nMR. WRITE\\nAhhhh, so you admit you don\\'t know what you\\'re talking about.  So if you\\'re through giving me your amateur opinion, lie back and listen to the news.  I\\'m taking you back to the rendezvous, Joe\\'s gonna get you a doctor, the doctor\\'s gonna fix you up, and you\\'re gonna be okay.  Now say it: you\\'re gonna be okay.  Say it: you\\'re gonna be okay!\\nMr. Orange doesn\\'t respond.  Mr. White starts pounding on the steering wheel.\\nMR. WHITE\\nSay-the-goddamn-words: you\\'re gonna be okay!12.}\\nMR. ORANGE\\nI\\'m okay.\\nMR. WHITE\\n(softly)\\nCorrect.\\nINT. WAREHOUSE - DAY 4 4\\nThe CAMERA does a 360 around an empty warehouse.  Then the \\ndoor swings open, and Mr. White carries the bloody body of Mr. Orange inside.\\nMr. Orange still is MOANING loudly from his bullet hit.Mr. White lays him down upon a mattress on the floor.\\nMR. WHITE\\nJust hold on buddy boy.  Hold on, \\nand wait for Joe.  I can\\'t do anything for you, but when Joe gets here, which should be anytime now, he\\'ll be able to help you. We\\'re just gonna sit here, and wait for Joe.  Who are we waiting for?\\nMR. ORANGE\\nJoe.\\nMR. WHITE\\nBet your sweet ass we are.\\nMr. White gets up from over Mr. Orange and starts to prowl around the warehouse.\\nMR. ORANGE\\n(yelling)\\nDon\\'t leave me!\\nMr White bends back over him and takes his hand.\\nMR. WHITE\\nI ain\\'t going anywhere.  I\\'m right here.  I\\'m not gonna leave ya.\\nMR. ORANGE\\nLarry, I\\'m so scared, would you please hold me.\\nMr. White very gently embraces the bloody Mr. Orange. Cradling the young man, Mr. White whispers to him.13.}\\nMR. WHITE\\n(whispering)\\nGo ahead and be scared, you\\'ve been \\nbrave enough for one day.  I want you to just relax now. You\\'re not gonna die, you\\'re gonna be fine.  When Joe gets here, he\\'ll make ya a hundred percent again.\\nMr. White lays Mr. Orange back down on the mattress.  He\\'s still holding his hand.  Mr. Orange looks up at his friend.\\nMR. ORANGE\\nLook, I don\\'t wanna be a fly in the ointment, but if help doesn\\'t come soon, I gotta see a doctor. I don\\'t give a fuck about jail, I just don\\'t wanna die.\\nMR. WHITE\\nYou\\'re not gonna fucking die, all right?\\nMR. ORANGE\\nI wasn\\'t born yesterday.  I\\'m hurt, and I\\'m hurt bad.\\nMR. WHITE\\nIt\\'s not good...\\nMR. ORANGE\\nHey, bless your heart for what you\\'re trying to do.  I was panicking for a moment, but I\\'ve got my senses back now.  The situation is, I\\'m shot in the belly.  And without medical attention, I\\'m gonna die.\\nMR. WHITE\\nI can\\' take you to a hospital.\\nMR. ORANGE\\nFuck jail!  I don\\'t give a shit about jail.  But I can\\'t die.  You don\\'t have to take me in.  Just drive me up to the front, drop me on the sidewalk.  I\\'ll take care of myself.  I won\\'t tell them anything.  I swear to fucking god, I won\\'t tell \\'em anything.  Look in my eyes, look right in my eyes.\\n(Mr. White does)14.}\\nI-won\\'t-tell-them-anything. You\\'ll \\nbe safe.\\nMR. WHITE\\nLie back down, and try to--\\nMR. ORANGE\\nI\\'m going to die!   I need a doctor!  I\\'m begging you, take me to a doctor.\\nMr. Orange lays his head back on the mattress.  Spent from his outburst, he quietly mutters to himself:\\nMR. ORANGE (CONT’D)\\nTake me to a doctor, take me to a doctor, please.\\nSuddenly, the warehouse door BURSTS open and Mr. Pink steps inside.\\nMR. PINK\\nWas that a fucking set-up or what?\\nMr. Pink sees Mr. Orange on the floor, shot and bloody.\\nMR. PINK (CONT’D)\\nOh fuck, Orange got tagged.\\nThroughout this scene, we hear Mr. Orange moaning.\\nMR. WHITE\\nGun shot.\\nMR. PINK\\nOh that\\'s just fucking great! Where\\'s Brown?\\nMR. WHITE\\nDead.\\nMR. PINK\\nGoddamn, goddamn!  How did he die?\\nMR. WHITE\\nHow the fuck do you think?  The cops shot him.\\nMR. PINK\\nOh this is bad, this is so bad.\\n(referring to Mr. Orange)\\nIs it bad?15.}\\nMR. WHITE\\nAs opposed to good?\\nMR. PINK\\nThis is so fucked up.  Somebody \\nfucked us big time.\\nMR. WHITE\\nYou really think we were set up?\\nMR. PINK\\nYou even doubt it?  I don\\'t think we got set up, I know we got set up!  I mean really, seriously, where did all those cops come from, huh?  One minute they\\'re not there, the next minute they\\'re there.  I didn\\'t hear any sirens.  The alarm went off, okay. Okay, when an alarm goes off, you got an average of four minutes response time.  Unless a patrol car is cruising that street, at that particular moment, you got four minutes before they can realistically respond.  In one minute there were seventeen blue boys out there.  All loaded for bear, all knowing exactly what the fuck they were doing, and they were all just there!  Remember that second wave that showed up in the cars? Those were the ones responding to the alarm.  but those other motherfuckers were already there, they were waiting for us.\\n(pause)\\nYou haven\\'t thought about this?\\nMR. WHITE\\nI haven\\'t had a chance to think. First I was just trying to get the fuck outta there.  And after we got away, I\\'ve just been dealin with him.\\nMR. PINK\\nWell, you better start thinking about it.  Cause I, sure as fuck, am thinking about it.  In fact, that\\'s all I\\'m thinking about.  I came this close to just driving off.  Whoever set us up, knows about this place.  16.}\\nThere could\\'ve been cops sitting \\nhere waiting for me.  For all we know, there\\'s cops, driving fast, on their way here now.\\nMR. WHITE\\nLet\\'s go in the other room...\\nThe camera creeps along a wall, coming to a corner.  We move past it, and see down a hall.\\nINT. BATHROOM HALLWAY - DAY 5 5\\nAt the end of the hall is a bathroom.  The bathroom door is \\npartially closed, restricting our view.  Mr. Pink is obscured, but Mr. White is in view.\\nMR. PINK (OS)\\nWhat the fuck am I doing here?  I felt funny about this job right off.  As soon as I felt it I should said \"No thank you\", and walked.  But I never fucking listen.  Every time I ever got burned buying weed, I always knew the guy wasn\\'t right.  I just felt it.  But I wanted to believe him. If he\\'s not lyin to me, and it really is Thai stick, then whoa baby.  But it\\'s never Thai stick. and I always said if I felt that way about a job, I\\'d walk.  And I did, and I didn\\'t, because of fuckin money!\\nMR. WHITE\\nWhat\\'s done is done, I need you cool.

Then Mr. Blonde starts shootin all the--\\nMR. PINK\\n--That\\'s not correct.\\nMR. WHITE\\nWhat\\'s wrong with it?\\nMR. PINK\\nThe cops didn\\'t show up after the alarm went off.  They didn\\'t show till after Mr. Blonde started shooting everyone.\\nMR. WHITE\\nAs soon as I heard the alarm, I saw the cops.\\nMR. PINK\\nI\\'m telling ya, it wasn\\'t that soon.  They didn\\'t let their presence be known until after Mr. Blonde went off.  I\\'m not sayin they weren\\'t there, I\\'m sayin they were there.  But they didn\\'t move in till Mr. Blonde became a madman.  That\\'s how I know we were set up.  You can see that, can\\'t you, Mr. White?\\nMR.

WHITE\\nUh-uh, just cops.\\nMR. PINK\\nCould you believe Mr. Blonde?\\nMR. WHITE\\nThat was one of the most insane fucking things I\\'ve ever seen. 20.}\\nWhy the fuck would Joe hire \\nsomebody like that?\\nMR. PINK\\nI don\\'t wanna kill anybody.  But if I gotta get out that door, and you\\'re standing in my way, one way of the other, you\\'re gettin outta my way.\\nMR. WHITE\\nThat\\'s the way I look at it.  A choice between doin ten years, and takin out some stupid motherfucker, ain\\'t no choice at all.  But I ain\\'t no madman either.  What the fuck was Joe thinkin?  You can\\'t work with a guy like that.  That mother- fucker\\'s unstable.  What do you think?  Do you think he panicked, or ya think he\\'s just trigger- happy?\\nMR. PINK\\nI think he\\'s a sick fuckin maniac! We\\'re awful goddamn lucky he didn\\'t tag us, when he shot up the place.  I came this fucking close--\\n(hold up two fingers and \\nmakes a tiny space between them)\\n--to taking his ass out myself. Everybody panics.  When things get tense, everybody panics. Everybody.  I don\\'t care what your name is, you can\\'t help it.  It\\'s human nature.  But ya panic on the inside.\\nYa panic in your head.  Ya give yourself a couple a seconds of panic, then you get a grip and deal with the situation.  What you don\\'t do, is shoot up the place and kill everybody.\\nMR. WHITE\\nWhat you\\'re supposed to do is act like a fuckin professional.  A psychopath is not a professional. You can\\'t work with a psychopath, \\'cause ya don\\'t know what those sick assholes are gonna do next. I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do you think that black girl was? Twenty, maybe twenty-one?21.}\\nMR. PINK\\nDid ya see what happened to anybody \\nelse?\\nMR. WHITE\\nMe and Mr. Orange jumped in the car and Mr. Brown floored it. After that, I don\\'t know what went down.\\nMR. PINK\\nAt that point it became every man for himself.  As far as Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue are concerned, I ain\\'t got the foggiest.  Once I got out, I never looked back.\\nMR. WHITE\\nWhat do you think?\\nMR. PINK\\nWhat do I think?  I think the cops caught them, or killed \\'em.\\nMR. WHITE\\nNot even a chance they punched through?  You found a hole.\\nMR. PINK\\nYeah, and that was a fucking miracle.  But if they did get away, where the fuck are they?\\nMR. WHITE\\nYou don\\'t think it\\'s possible, one of them got ahold of the diamonds and pulled a--\\nMR. PINK\\nNope.\\nMR. WHITE\\nHow can you be so sure?\\nMR. PINK\\nI got the diamonds.\\nMR. WHITE\\nWhere?\\nMR. PINK\\nI got \\'em, all right?\\nMR. WHITE\\nWhere?  Are they out in the car?22.}\\nMR. PINK\\nNo, they\\'re not in the car.  No, I \\ndon\\'t have them on me.  Ya wanna go with me and get \\'em?  Yes, we can go right now.  But first listen to what I\\'m telling you. We were fuckin set up!  Somebody is in league with the cops.  We got a Judas in our midst.  And I\\'m thinkin we should have our fuckin heads examined for waiting around here.\\nMR. WHITE\\nThat was the plan, we meet here.\\nMR. PINK\\nThen where is everybody?  I say the plan became null and void once we found out we got a rat in the house.  We ain\\'t got the slightest fuckin idea what happened to Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue.  They could both be dead\\nor arrested.  They could be sweatin \\'em, down at the station house right now.  Yeah they don\\'t know the names, but they can sing about this place. I mean, that could be happening right now.  As we speak, the cops could be in their cars, drivin here this minute.\\nMR. WHITE\\nI swear to god I\\'m fuckin jinxed.\\nMR. PINK\\nWhat?\\nMR. WHITE\\nTwo jobs back, it was a four man job, we discovered one of the team was an undercover cop.\\nMR. PINK\\nNo shit?\\nMR. WHITE\\nThank god, we discovered in time. We hadda forget the whole fuckin thing.  Just walked away from it.\\nMR. PINK\\nSo who\\'s the rat this time?  Mr. Blue?  Mr. Blonde?  Joe?  23.}\\nIt\\'s Joe\\'s show, he set this whole \\nthing up.  Maybe he set it up to set it up.\\nMR. WHITE\\nI don\\'t buy it.  Me and Joe go back a long time.  I can tell ya straight up, Joe definitely didn\\'t have anything to do with this bullshit.\\nMR. PINK\\nOh, you and Joe go back a long time.  I known Joe since I was a kid.  But me saying Joe definitely couldn\\'t have done it is ridiculous.  I can say I definitely didn\\'t do it, cause I know what I did or didn\\'t do.  But I can\\'t definitely say that about anybody else, \\'cause I don\\'t definitely know.  For all I know, you\\'re the rat.\\nMR. WHITE\\nFor all I know, you\\'re the rat.\\nMR. PINK\\nNow you\\'re using your head. For all we know, he\\'s the rat.\\nMr. Pink points OFFSCREEN to Mr. Orange.  Mr. White\\'s expression changes.\\nMR. WHITE\\nJesus Christ!\\nINT. WAREHOUSE - DAY 11 11\\nThey run over to Mr. Orange, who\\'s unconscious.  The CAMERA hovers over the action.  Mr. Pink reaches him first.\\nMR. PINK\\nIs he dead?\\nMr. White pushes him out of the way.  He feels the pulse on Mr. Orange\\'s neck.\\nMR. PINK (CONT’D)\\nSo, is he dead or what?\\nMR. WHITE\\nHe ain\\'t dead.24.}\\nMR. PINK\\nSo what is it?\\nMR. WHITE\\nI think he\\'s just passed out.\\nMR. PINK\\nHe scared the fuckin shit outta me.  \\nI thought he was dead fer sure.\\nMr. White stands up and walks over to a table.\\nMR. WHITE\\nHe will be dead fer sure, if we don\\'t get him to a hospital.\\nMR. PINK\\nWe can\\'t take him to a hospital.\\nMR. WHITE\\nWithout medical attention, this man won\\'t live through the night. That bullet in his belly is my fault.  Now while that might not mean jack shit to you, it means a helluva lot to me.  And I\\'m not gonna just sit around and watch him die.\\nMR. PINK\\nWell, first things first, staying here\\'s goofy.  We gotta book up.\\nMR. WHITE\\nSo what do you suggest, we go to a hotel?  We got a guy who\\'s shot in the belly, he can\\'t walk, he bleeds like a stuck pig, and when he\\'s awake, he screams in pain.\\nMR. PINK\\nYou gotta idea, spit it out.\\nMR. WHITE\\nJoe could help him.  If we can get in touch with Joe, Joe could get him to a doctor, Joe could get a doctor to come and see him.\\nDuring Mr. Pink\\'s dialog, we slowly ZOOM in to a C.U. of Mr. White.\\nMR. PINK (OS)\\nAssuming we can trust Joe, how we gonna get in touch with him?  25.}\\nHe\\'s supposed to be here, but he \\nain\\'t, which is making me nervous about being here.  Even if Joe is on the up and up, he\\'s probably not gonna be that happy with us. Joe planned a robbery, but he\\'s got a blood bath on his hands now. Dead cops, dead robbers, dead civilians...Jesus Christ!  I tend to doubt he\\'s gonna have a lot of sympathy for our plight.  If I was him, I\\'d try and put as much distance between me and this mess an humanly possible.\\nMR. WHITE\\nBefore you got here, Mr. Orange was askin me to take him to a hospital.  Now I don\\'t like turning him over to the cops, but if we don\\'t, he\\'s dead.  He begged me to do it.  I told him to hold off till Joe got here.\\nMR. PINK (OS)\\nWell Joe ain\\'t gettin here.  We\\'re on our own.  Now, I don\\'t know a goddamn body who can help him, so if you know somebody, call \\'em.\\nMR. WHITE\\nI don\\'t know anybody.\\nMR. PINK (OS)\\nWell, I guess we drop him off at the hospital.  Since he don\\'t know nothin about us, I say it\\'s his decision.\\nMR. WHITE\\'S \\nPOV:\\nC.U. OF MR. PINK.\\nMR. WHITE (OS)\\nWell, he knows a little about me.\\nMR. PINK\\nYou didn\\'t tell him your name, did ya?\\nMR. WHITE (OS)\\nI told him my first name, and where I\\'m from.26.}\\nThere is a long silence and a blank look from Mr. Pink, then \\nhe SCREAMS:\\nMR. PINK\\nWhy!\\nMR. WHITE (OS)\\nI told him where I was from a few days ago.  It was just a casual conversation.\\nMR. PINK\\nAnd what was tellin him your name when you weren\\'t supposed to?\\nMR. WHITE (OS)\\nHe asked.\\nMr. Pink looks at Mr. White like he\\'s retarded.\\nMR. WHITE (OS) (CONT’D)\\nWe had just gotten away from the cops.  He just got shot.  It was my fuckin fault he got shot.  He\\'s a fuckin bloody mess - he\\'s screaming.  I swear to god, I thought we was gonna die right then and there.  I\\'m tryin to comfort him, telling him not to worry, he\\'s gonna be okay, I\\'m gonna take care of him.  And he asked me what my name was.  I mean, the man was dyin in my arms. What the fuck was I supposed to tell him, \"Sorry, I can\\'t give out that information, it\\'s against the rules.  I don\\'t trust you enough.\"?  Maybe I shoulda, but I couldn\\'t.\\nMR. PINK\\nOh, I don\\'t doubt is was quite beautiful--\\nMR. WHITE (OS)\\nDon\\'t fuckin patronize me.\\nMR. PINK\\nOne question: Do they have a sheet on you, where you told him you\\'re from?\\nMR. WHITE (OS)\\nOf course.27.}\\nMR. PINK\\nWell that\\'s that, then.  I mean, I \\nwas worried about mug shot possibilities already.  But now he knows: (a) what you look like, (b) what your first name is, (i) where you\\'re from and (d) what your specialty is. They ain\\'t gonna hafta show him a helluva lot of pictures for him to pick you out.  That\\'s it right, you didn\\'t tell him anything else that could narrow down the selection?\\nMR. WHITE (OS)\\nIf I have to tell you again to back off, me an you are gonna go round and round.\\nMr. Pink walks out of the C.U. and turns his back on Mr. White.  Mr. White\\'s POV PANS over to him.\\nMR. PINK\\nWe ain\\'t taking him to a hospital.\\nMR. WHITE (OS)\\nIf we don\\'t, he\\'ll die.\\nMR. PINK\\nAnd I\\'m very sad about that.  But some fellas are lucky, and some ain\\'t.\\nMR.

WHITE\\nYou wanna shoot me, you little piece of shit?  Take a shot!\\nMR. PINK\\nFuck you, White!  I didn\\'t create this situation,  I\\'m just dealin with it.  You\\'re acting like a first-year fuckin thief.  I\\'m actin like a professional.  They get him, they can get you, they get you, they get closer to me, and that can\\'t happen.  And you, you motherfucker, are looking at me like it\\'s my fault.  I didn\\'t tell him my name.  I didn\\'t tell him where I was from.  I didn\\'t tell him what I knew better than to tell him.  Fuck, fifteen minutes ago, you almost told me your name.  You, buddy, are stuck in a situation you created.

You wanna roll around on the floor, do it in Eddie\\'s office, not mine!\\nThe two men break it up.  They are completely disheveled, hair a mess, shirttails out.

He\\'s reading it pretty good, but he\\'s still reading it from the page, and every once in a while he stumbles over his words.\\nFREDDY\\n...this was during the Los Angeles marijuana drought of \\'86.  I still had a connection.  Which was insane, \\'cause you couldn\\'t get weed anyfuckinwhere then.  Anyway, I had a connection with this hippie chick up in Santa Cruz. All and my friends knew it.  And they\\'d give me a call and say, \"Hey, Freddy, you buyin some, you think you could buy me some too?\" They knew I smoked, so they\\'d ask me to buy a little for them when I was buyin.  But it got to be everytime I bought some weed, I was buyin for four or five different people.  Finally I said, \"Fuck this shit.\"  I\\'m makin this bitch rich.  She didn\\'t have to do jack shit, she never even had to meet these people.  I was fuckin doin all the work.  So I got together with her and told her, \"Hey, I\\'m sick of this shit.  I\\'m comin through for everybody, and nobody\\'s comin through for me. So, either I\\'m gonna tell all my friends to find their own source, or you give me a bunch of weed, I\\'ll sell it to them, give you the money, minus ten percent, and I get my pot for free.\"  So, I did if for awhile...\\nFreddy exits frame\\nCUT TO:\\nEXT.

Freddy paces back and forth as he performs his story.59.}\\nFREDDY\\n...but then that got to be a pain \\nin the ass.  People called me on the phone all the fuckin time.  I couldn\\'t rent a fuckin tape without six phone calls interrupting me.  \"Hey, Freddy, when\\'s the next time you\\'re gettin some?\"  \"Motherfucker, I\\'m tryin to watch \\'Lost Boys\\'-- when I have some, I\\'ll let you know.\"  And then these rinky-dink pot heads come by--there\\'s my friends and everything, but still.  I got all my shit laid out in sixty dollar bags.  Well, they don\\'t want sixty dollars worth.  They want ten dollars worth.  Breaking it up is a major fuckin pain in the ass.  I don\\'t even know how much ten dollars worth is.  \"Well, fuck, man, I don\\'t want that much around.  If I have that much around I\\'ll smoke it.\"  \"Hey, if you guys can\\'t control your smokin, that\\'s not my problem. You motherfuckers been smokin for five years, be a adult about it.\" Finally I just told my connection, count me out.  But as it turns out, I\\'m the best guy she had, and she depended alot on my business. But I was still sick to death of it.  And she\\'s trying to talk me into not quitin.\\nNow this was a very weird situation, \\'cause I don\\'t know if you remember back in \\'86, there was a major fuckin drought. Nobody and anything.  People were livin on resin and smokin the wood in their pipes for months.  And this chick had a bunch, and was beggin me to sell it.  So I told her I wasn\\'t gonna be Joe the Pot Man anymore.  But I would take a little bit and sell it to my close, close, close friends.  She agreed to that, and said we\\'d keep the same arrangement as before, ten percent and free pot for me, as long as I helped her out that weekend.

I \\nfound something else out I think you two should be aware of. About a year and a half ago, up in Sacramento, an undercover cop, John Dolenz, worked his way into a bank job.  Apparently before the job they found out he was a cop. Now picture this:  It\\'s Dolenz\\'s birthday, a bunch of cops are waiting in his apartment for a surprise party.  The door opens, everyone yells \"Surprise!\", and standing in the doorway is Dolenz and this other guy sticking a gun in Dolenz\\'s ribs.  Before anybody knows what\\'s going on, this stranger shoots Dolenz dead and starts firing two .45 automatics into the crowd.\\nHOLDAWAY\\nWhat happened?\\nThe DOLLY moves behind Jodie.\\nJODIE\\nIt was a mess.  Cops got hit, wives got hit, girlfriends got hit, his dog got hit.  People got glass in their faces.  Three were killed, six were wounded.\\nFREDDY\\nThey couldn\\'t pin the killing on one of the bank robbers?\\nJODIE\\nThey tried, but they didn\\'t have a positive I.D. and all those guys had alibis.  Besides, we really didn\\'t have anything on them.  We had the testimony of a dead man that they were talking about committing a robbery.

PINK\\nYeah, those guys too.\\nEDDIE\\nLet me tell you guys a story.  In \\none of daddy\\'s clubs there was this black cocktail waitress named Elois.\\nMR. WHITE\\nElois?\\nEDDIE\\nYeah, Elois. E and Lois.  We called her Lady E.\\nMR. WHITE\\nWhere was she from, Compton?\\nEDDIE\\nNo.  She was from Ladora Heights.\\nMR. PINK\\nThe black Beverly Hills.  I knew this lady from Ladora Heights once.\\n(in a stuck up black \\nfemale voice)\\n\"Hi, I\\'m from Ladora Heights, it\\'s the black Beverly Hills.\"\\nEDDIE\\nIt\\'s not the black Beverly Hills, it\\'s the black Palos Verdes. Anyway, this chick, Elois, was a man-eater-upper.  I bet every guy who\\'s ever met her has jacked off to her at least once.  You know who she looked like?  Christie Love.  \\'Member that TV show \"Get Christie Love\"?  She was a black female cop.  She always used to say \"You\\'re under arrest, sugar.\"\\nMR. PINK\\nI was in the sixth grade when that show was on.  I totally dug it. What the fuck was the name of the chick who played Christie Love?\\nEDDIE\\nPam Grier.71.}\\nMR. PINK\\nNo, it wasn\\'t Pan Grier, Pan Grier \\nwas the other one.  Pan Grier made the movies.  Christie Love was like a Pam Grier TV show, without Pam Grier.\\nMR. PINK (CONT’D)\\nWhat the fuck was that chick\\'s name?  Oh this is just great, I\\'m totally fuckin tortured now.\\nEDDIE\\nWell, whoever she was, Elois looked like her.  So one night I walk into the club, and no Elois. Now the bartender was a wetback, he was a friend of mine, his name was Carlos.\\nSo I asked him \"Hey, Carlos, where\\'s Lady E tonight?\"  Well apparently Lady E was married to this real piece of dog shit.  I mean a real animal.  And apparently he would so things to her.\\nFREDDY\\nDo things?  What would he do?  You mean like beat her up?\\nEDDIE\\nNobody knows for sure what he did. We just know he did something. Anyway, Elois plays it real cool. And waits for the next time this bag of shit gets drunk.  So one night the guy gets drunk and passes out on the couch.  So while the guy\\'s\\ninebriated, she strips him naked. Then she takes some crazy glue and glues his dick to his belly.\\nThe car reacts to how horrible that would be.\\nEDDIE (CONT’D)\\nI\\'m dead fuckin serious.  She put \\nsome on his dick and some on his belly, then stuck \\'em together. The paramedics had to come and cut it loose.\\nThe car reacts badly.72.}\\nMR.

You guys don\\'t say shit about who you are, where you been or what you\\'ve done.  Only thing you guys can talk about is what you\\'re going to do.  This way the only ones who know who the members of the team are are Eddie and myself.  And that\\'s the way I like it.  Because in the unlikely event of one of you getting apprehended by the cops, not that I expect that to happen - it most definitely should not happen - it hasn\\'t happened, you don\\'t have anything to deal with.  You don\\'t know any names.  You know my name, you know Eddie\\'s name.  That I don\\'t care about.  You gotta prove it.  I ain\\'t worried.  Besides, this way you gotta trust me.  I like that.  I set this up and picked the men I wanted for it. None of you came to me, I approached all of you.  I know you.  I know your work, I know your reputation.  I know you as men.

You always knew we\\'d hang back until Joe Cabot showed up.\\nFREDDY\\nOh this is great.  You ain\\'t giving me no fuckin protection whatsoever.  But you are giving me an attitude.\\nHOLDAWAY\\nSince when does an undercover cop have protection?  Freddy, you came into this thing with your eyes wide open, so don\\'t start screamin blind man now.  I understand you\\'re nervous.  I wish the warehouse had more visible windows, but it doesn\\'t.  We have to make do with the cards we\\'re dealt.\\nFREDDY\\nI didn\\'t say I wasn\\'t gonna do it. I\\'m just remarking on how shitty the situation is!\\nHOLDAWAY\\nI don\\'t mean to be harsh with ya, but I\\'ve found tough love works best in these situations.  We have to get Joe Cabot in the company of the thieves and in the same vicinity as the loot. We don\\'t care about these other bastards.  We\\'re willing to offer them good deals to testify against Cabot.\\nFREDDY\\nIsn\\'t this risk unorthodox?\\nHOLDAWAY\\nWhat?\\nFREDDY\\nLetting them go ahead with the robbery?78.}\\nHOLDAWAY\\nThe whole idea behind this \\noperation is to catch Joe Cabot red-handed.  We bust these hired hands, we ain\\'t accomplished shit. Letting them go through with the heist is a risk, but Cabot\\'s jobs are very clean.  We got people surrounding the perimeter.  We got a guy and a gal on the inside posing as a couple shopping for rings.  We could replace the employees with cops, but we\\'d run the risk of tipping \\'em off.\\nFREDDY\\nThat\\'s out.

WHITE\\nWhen you\\'re dealing with a store like this, they\\'re insured up the ass.  They\\'re not supposed to give you and resistance whatsoever.  If you get a customer or an employee who thinks he\\'s Charles Bronson, take the butt of your gun and smash their nose in. Drops \\'em right to the floor. Everyone jumps, he falls down, screaming, blood squirts out his nose.  Freaks everybody out. Nobody says fuckin shit after that.  You might get some bitch talk shit to ya.  But give her a look, like you\\'re gonna smash her in the face next.  Watch her shut the fuck up.  Now if it\\'s a manager, that\\'s a different story. The managers know better than to fuck around.  So if one\\'s givin you static, he probably thinks he\\'s a real cowboy.  So what you gotta do is break that son-of-a- bitch in two.

WHITE\\nI don\\'t believe you just said that.\\nEDDIE\\nNo, it was messy as hell, but do you realize how much you got away with?  There\\'s over two million dollars worth of diamonds here.\\nMR. PINK\\nI love this guy.\\nEDDIE\\nHey, what\\'s done is done.  We can all sit around and have a big cry about it or we can deal with the situation at hand.\\nMR.

WHITE\\nObviously not enough.\\nEDDIE\\nFuck you! You gotta little black book, then whip is out.  If not, listen how it is.  I called three doctors and couldn\\'t get through to shit.  Now, time being a factor, I called Bonnie.  Sweet broad, helluva broad, and a registered nurse.  Told her a bullshit story, upside:  she said bring him to her apartment.\\nMR. WHITE\\nIf he dies I\\'m holding you personally responsible.\\nEDDIE\\nFuck you buddy boy!  Okay, you wanna play that way.  I am personally leaving myself vulnerable with this Bonnie situation.

PINK\\n(to Mr. White)\\nLook, he\\'s not sayin this bitch is gonna operate on him.  She\\'s gonna give him better attention than we can until we can get a doctor. Nobody\\'s forgotten about doctors.

They stop in their tracks.\\nWe see what they see.  Mr. Blonde, lying on the ground, shot \\nfull of holes.  The cop slumped over in his chair, a bloody mess, Mr. Orange lying at the cop\\'s feet, holding his wound.  Eddie, Mr. White and Mr. Pink walk into the shot.\\nEDDIE\\nWhat the fuck happened here?\\nEddie runs over to his friend Mr. Blonde/Toothpick Vic.\\nMR. WHITE\\n(to Mr. Orange)\\nWhat happened?\\nMR. ORANGE\\n(very weakly)\\nBlonde went crazy.  He slashed the cop\\'s face, cut off his ear and was gonna burn him alive.85.}\\nEDDIE\\n(yelling)\\nWho cares what he was gonna do to \\nthis fuckin pig?\\nEddie whips out his gun and SHOOTS the cop.

ORANGE\\nLook, Eddie, he was pullin a burn. He was gonna kill the cop and me. And when you guys walked through the door, he was gonna blow you to hell and make off with the diamonds.\\nMR. WHITE\\n(to Eddie)\\nUhuh, uhuh, what\\'s I tell ya? That sick piece of shit was a stone cold psycho.\\nMR. ORANGE\\n(to Eddie)\\nYou could\\'ve asked the cop, if you didn\\'t just kill him.

Eddie, you didn\\'t see how he acted during the job, we did.\\nMr. Pink walks over to the cop\\'s body.\\nMR. PINK\\nHe\\'s right about the ear, it\\'s hacked off.86.}\\nEDDIE\\n(to Mr. Orange)\\nLet me say this out loud, just to \\nget it straight in my mind.

I swear on my mother\\'s eternal soul that\\'s what happened.\\nThe CAMERA mover into a C.U. of Nice Guy Eddie.\\nThere\\'s a long pause while he rolls over what Mr. Orange has \\nsaid.  Finally:\\nEDDIE\\nYou\\'re a fuckin liar.  Now why don\\'t you drop the fuckin fairy tale and tell me what really happened?\\nMR. WHITE (OS)\\nHe told you what really happened. You just can\\'t deal with it.\\nMR. ORANGE (OS)\\nOkay, you\\'re right, I\\'m lying. Even though I\\'m fuckin dyin I\\'m not above pullin a fast one.  Get rid of Blonde, we share his split - no, scratch that, I shot him \\'cause I didn\\'t like his hair style.  I didn\\'t like his shoes either.  If it has just been his hair, I\\'d\\'ve maybe, maybe I said, let him live.  But hair and footwear together, he\\'s a goner.\\nEDDIE\\nThe man you killed was just released from prison.  He got caught at a company warehouse full of hot items.  He could\\'ve walked away.  All he had to do was say my dad\\'s name.  But instead he shut his mouth and did his time.  He did four years for us, and he did \\'em like a man.  87.}\\nAnd we were very grateful.  So, Mr. \\nOrange, you\\'re tellin me this very good friend of mine, who did four years for my father, who in four years never made a deal, no matter what they dangled in front of him, you\\'re telling me that now, that now this man is free, and we\\'re making good on our commitment to him, he\\'s just gonna decide, right out of the fuckin blue, to rip us off?\\nSilence.\\nEDDIE (CONT’D)\\nMr. Orange, why don\\'t you tell me what really happened?\\nVOICE (OS)\\nWhy?

UNCLE BOB\\'S PANCAKE HOUSE - MORNING 1 1\\nEight men dressed in BLACK SUITS, sit around a table at a \\nbreakfast cafe.  They are MR. WHITE, MR. PINK, MR. BLUE,\\nMR. BLONDE, MR. ORANGE, MR. BROWN, NICE GUY EDDIE CABOT,and the big boss, JOE CABOT.  Most are finished eating and \\nare enjoying coffee and conversation.  Joe flips through a small address book.  Mr. Pink is telling a long and involved story about Madonna.\\nMR. PINK\\n\"Like a Virgin\" is all about a girl who digs a guy with a big dick.  The whole song is a metaphor for big dicks.\\nMR. BLUE\\nNo it\\'s not.  It\\'s about a girl who is very vulnerable and she\\'s been fucked over a few times. Then she meets some guy who\\'s really sensitive--\\nMR. PINK\\n--Whoa...whoa...time out Greenbay. Tell that bullshit to the tourists.\\nJOE\\n(looking through his \\naddress book)\\nToby...who the fuck is Toby? Toby...Toby...think...think... think...\\nMR. PINK\\nIt\\'s not about a nice girl who meets a sensitive boy.  Now granted that\\'s what \"True Blue\" is about, no argument about that.\\nMR. ORANGE\\nWhich one is \"True Blue?\"\\nNICE GUY EDDIE\\nYou don\\'t remember \"True Blue?\" That was a big ass hit for Madonna.  Shit, I don\\'t even follow this Tops In Pops shit, and I\\'ve at least heard of \"True Blue.\"}\\nMR. ORANGE\\nLook, asshole, I didn\\'t say I ain\\'t \\nheard of it.  All I asked was how does it go?  Excuse me for not being the world\\'s biggest Madonna fan.\\nMR. BROWN\\nI hate Madonna.\\nMR. BLUE\\nI like her early stuff.  You know, \"Lucky Star,\" \"Borderline\" - but once she got into her \"Papa Don\\'t Preach\" phase, I don\\'t know, I tuned out.\\nMR. PINK\\nHey, fuck all that, I\\'m making a point here.  You\\'re gonna make me lose my train of thought.\\nJOE\\nOh fuck, Toby\\'s that little china girl.\\nMR. WHITE\\nWhat\\'s that?\\nJOE\\nI found this old address book in a jacket I ain\\'t worn in a coon\\'s age.  Toby what?  What the fuck was her last name?\\nMR. PINK\\nWhere was I?\\nMR. ORANGE\\nYou said \"True Blue\" was about a nice girl who finds a sensitive fella.  But \"Like a Virgin\" was a metaphor for big dicks.\\nMR. PINK\\nLet me tell ya what \"Like a Virgin\"\\'s about.  It\\'s about some cooze who\\'s a regular fuck machine.\\nI mean all the time, morning, day, night, afternoon, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick.\\nMR. BLUE\\nHow many dicks was that?2.}\\nMR. WHITE\\nA lot.\\nMR. PINK\\nThen one day she meets a John \\nHolmes motherfucker, and it\\'s like, whoa baby.  This mother fucker\\'s like Charles Bronson in \"The Great Escape.\"  He\\'s diggin tunnels.  Now she\\'s gettin this serious dick action, she\\'s feelin something she ain\\'t felt since forever.  Pain.\\nJOE\\nChew?  Toby Chew?  No.\\nMR. PINK\\nIt hurts.  It hurts her.  It shouldn\\'t hurt.  Her pussy should be Bubble-Yum by now.  But when this cat fucks her, it hurts.  It hurts like the first time.  The pain is reminding a fuck machine what is was like to be a virgin. Hence, \"Like a Virgin.\"\\nThe fellas crack up.\\nJOE\\nWong?\\nMR. PINK\\nFuck you, wrong.  I\\'m right!  What the fuck do you know about it anyway?  You\\'re still listening to Jerry-fucking-Vale.\\nJOE\\nNot wrong, dumb ass, Wong!  You know, like the Chinese name?\\nMr. White snatches the address book from Joe\\'s hand.  They fight, but they\\'re not really mad at each other.\\nMR. WHITE\\nGive me this fucking thing.\\nJOE\\nWhat the fuck do you think you\\'re doin?  Give me my book back!\\nMR. WHITE\\nI\\'m sick of fuckin hearin it Joe, I\\'ll give it back when we leave.3.}\\nJOE\\nWhaddaya mean, give it to me when \\nwe leave, give it back now.\\nMR. WHITE\\nFor the past fifteen minutes now, you\\'ve just been droning on with names.  \"Toby...Toby...Toby... Toby Wong...Toby Wong...Toby Chung...fuckin Charlie Chan.\"  I got Madonna\\'s big dick outta my right ear, and Toby Jap I-don\\'t- know-what, outta my left.\\nJOE\\nWhat do you care?\\nMR. WHITE\\nWhen you\\'re annoying as hell, I care a lot.\\nJOE\\nGive me my book.\\nMR. WHITE\\nYou gonna put it away?\\nJOE\\nI\\'m gonna do whatever I wanna do with it.\\nMR. WHITE\\nWell, then, I\\'m afraid I\\'m gonna have to keep it.\\nMR. BLONDE\\nJoe, you want me to shoot him for you?\\nMR. WHITE\\nShit, you shoot me in a dream, you better wake up and apologize.\\nNICE GUY EDDIE\\nHave you guys been listening to K- BILLY\\'s super sounds of the seventies weekend?\\nMR. PINK\\nYeah, it\\'s fuckin great isn\\'t it?\\nNICE GUY EDDIE\\nCan you believe the songs they been playin?4.}\\nMR. PINK\\nNo, I can\\'t.  You know what I heard \\nthe other day?  \"Heartbeat - It\\'s Lovebeat,\" by little Tony DeFranco and the DeFranco Family. I haven\\'t heard that since I was in fifth fuckin grade.\\nNICE GUY EDDIE\\nWhen I was coming down here, I was playin it.  And \"The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia\" came on.  Now I ain\\'t heard that song since it was big, but when it was big, I heard it a million- trillion times.  I\\'m listening to it this morning, and this was the first time I ever realized that the lady singing the song, was the one who killed Andy.\\nMR. BLUE\\nYou didn\\'t know Vicki Lawrence killed the guy?\\nNICE GUY EDDIE\\nI thought the cheatin wife shot Andy.\\nMR. BLONDE\\nThey say it in the song.\\nNICE GUY EDDIE\\nI know, I heard it.  I musta zoned out whenever that part came on before.  I thought when she said that little sister stuff, she was talkin about her sister- in-law, the cheatin wife.\\nJOE\\nNo, she did it.  She killed the cheatin wife, too.\\nMR. PINK\\nYou know the part in \"Gypsies, Tramps and Theives,\" when she says \"Poppa woulda shot his if he knew what he\\'d done?\"  I could never figure out what he did.\\nThe table laughs.  The WAITRESS comes over to the table. She has the check, and a pot of coffee.5.}\\nWAITRESS\\nCan I get anybody more coffee.\\nJOE\\nNo, we\\'re gonna be hittin it. I\\'ll \\ntake care of the check.\\nShe hands the bill to him.\\nWAITRESS\\nHere ya go.  Please pay at the register, if you wouldn\\'t mind.\\nJOE\\nSure thing.\\nWAITRESS\\nYou guys have a wonderful day.\\nThey all mutter equivalents.  She exits and Joe stands up.\\nJOE\\nI\\'ll take care of this, you guys leave the tip.\\n(to Mr. White)\\nAnd when I come back, I want my book back.\\nMR. WHITE\\nSorry, it\\'s my book now.\\nJOE\\nBlonde, shoot this piece of shit, will ya?\\nMr. Blonde shoots Mr. White with his finger.  Mr White acts shot.  Joe exits.\\nNICE GUY EDDIE\\nOkay, everybody cough up green for the little lady.\\nEverybody whips out a buck, and throws it on the table. Everybody, that is, except Mr. White.\\nNICE GUY EDDIE (CONT’D)\\nC\\'mon, throw in a buck.\\nMR. WHITE\\nUh-uh.  I don\\'t tip.\\nNICE GUY EDDIE\\nWhaddaya mean you don\\'t tip?6.}\\nMR. WHITE\\nI don\\'t believe in it.\\nNICE GUY EDDIE\\nYou don\\'t believe in tipping?\\nMR. PINK\\n(laughing)\\nI love this kid, he\\'s a madman, \\nthis guy.\\nMR. BLONDE\\nDo you have any idea what these ladies make?  They make shit.\\nMR. WHITE\\nDon\\'t give me that.  She don\\'t make enough money, she can quit.\\nEverybody laughs.\\nNICE GUY EDDIE\\nI don\\'t even know a Jew who\\'d have the balls to say that.  So let\\'s get this straight. You never ever tip?\\nMR. WHITE\\nI don\\'t tip because society says I gotta.  I tip when somebody deserves a tip.  When somebody really puts forth an effort, they deserve a little something extra. But this tipping automatically, that shit\\'s for the birds.  As far as I\\'m concerned, they\\'re just doin their job.\\nMR. BLUE\\nOur girl was nice.\\nMR. WHITE\\nOur girl was okay.  She didn\\'t do anything special.\\nMR. BLONDE\\nWhat\\'s something special, take ya in the kitchen and suck your dick?\\nThey all laugh.\\nNICE GUY EDDIE\\nI\\'d go over twelve percent for that.7.}\\nMR. WRITE\\nLook, I ordered coffee.  Now we\\'ve \\nbeen here a long fuckin time, and she\\'s only filled my cup three times.  When I order coffee,  I want it filled six times.\\nMR. BLONDE\\nWhat if she\\'s too busy?\\nMR. WHITE\\nThe words \"too busy\" shouldn\\'t be in a waitress\\'s vocabulary.\\nNICE GUY EDDIE\\nExcuse me, Mr. White, but the last thing you need is another cup of coffee.\\nThey all laugh.\\nMR. WHITE\\nThese ladies aren\\'t starvin to death.  They make minimum wage. When I worked for minimum wage, I wasn\\'t lucky enough to have a job that society deemed tipworthy.\\nNICE GUY EDDIE\\nAhh, now we\\'re getting down to it. It\\'s not just that he\\'s a cheap bastard--\\nMR. ORANGE\\n--It is that too--\\nNICE GUY EDDIE\\n--It is that too.  But it\\'s also he couldn\\'t get a waiter job.  You talk like a pissed off dishwasher: \"Fuck those cunts and their fucking tips.\"\\nMR. BLONDE\\nSo you don\\'t care that they\\'re counting on your tip to live?\\nMr. White rubs two of his fingers together.\\nMR. WHITE\\nDo you know what this is?  It\\'s the world\\'s smallest violin, playing just for the waitresses.8.}\\nMR. BLONDE\\nYou don\\'t have any idea what you\\'re \\ntalking about.  These people bust their ass. This is a hard job.\\nMR. WHITE\\nSo\\'s working at McDonald\\'s, but you don\\'t feel the need to tip them.  They\\'re servin ya food, you should tip em.  But no, society says tip these guys over here, but not those guys over there.  That\\'s bullshit.\\nMR. ORANGE\\nThey work harder than the kids at McDonald\\'s.\\nMR. WHITE\\nOh yeah, I don\\'t see them cleaning fryers.\\nMR. BROWN\\nThese people are taxed on the tips they make.  When you stiff \\'em, you cost them money.\\nMR. BLONDE\\nWaitressing is the number one occupation for female non-college graduates in this country.  It\\'s the one jab basically any woman can get, and make a living on. The reason is because of tips.\\nMR. WHITE\\nFuck all that.\\nThey all laugh.\\nMR. WHITE (CONT’D)\\nHey, I\\'m very sorry that the government taxes their tips. That\\'s fucked up.  But that ain\\'t my fault.  it would appear that waitresses are just one of the many groups the government fucks in the ass on a regular basis. You show me a paper says the government shouldn\\'t do that, I\\'ll sign it.  Put it to a vote, I\\'ll vote for it.  But what I won\\'t do is play ball.  9.}\\nAnd this non- college bullshit \\nyou\\'re telling me, I got two words for that: \"Learn to fuckin type.\"  Cause if you\\'re expecting me to help out with the rent, you\\'re in for a big fuckin surprise.\\nMR. ORANGE\\nHe\\'s convinced me.  Give me my dollar back.\\nEverybody laughs.  Joe\\'s comes back to the table.\\nJOE\\nOkay ramblers, let\\'s get to rambling.  Wait a minute, who didn\\'t throw in?\\nMR. ORANGE\\nMr. White.\\nJOE\\n(to Mr. Orange)\\nMr. White?\\n(to Mr. White)\\nWhy?\\nMR. ORANGE\\nHe don\\'t tip.\\nJOE\\n(to Mr. Orange)\\nHe don\\'t tip?\\n(to Mr. White)\\nYou don\\'t tip?  Why?\\nMR. ORANGE\\nHe don\\'t believe in it.\\nJOE\\n(to Mr. Orange)\\nHe don\\'t believe in it?\\n(to Mr. White)\\nYou don\\'t believe in it?\\nMR. ORANGE\\nNope.\\nJOE\\n(to Mr. Orange)\\nShut up!\\n(to Mr. White)10.}\\nCough up the buck, ya cheap \\nbastard, I paid for your goddamn breakfast.\\nMR. WHITE\\nBecause you paid for the breakfast, I\\'m gonna tip. Normally I wouldn\\'t.\\nJOE\\nWhatever.  Just throw in your dollar, and let\\'s move.\\n(to Mr. Blonde)\\nSee what I\\'m dealing with here. Infants.  I\\'m fuckin dealin with infants.\\nThe eight men get up to leave.  Mr. White\\'s waist is in the F.G.  As he buttons his coat, for a second we see he\\'s carrying a gun.  They exit Uncle Bob\\'s Pancake House, talking amongst themselves.\\nEXT. UNCLE BOB\\'S PANCAKE HOUSE - DAY 2 2\\nCREDIT \\nSEQUENCE:\\nWhen the credit sequence is finished, we    FADE TO BLACK:Over the BLACK we hear the sound of SOMEONE SCREAMING in \\nagony.\\nUnder the screaming, we hear the sound of a car HAULING ASS, \\nthrough traffic.\\nOver the screams and the traffic noise, we hear SOMEBODY\\nELSE SAY:\\nSOMEBODY ELSE (OS)\\nJust hold on buddy boy.\\nSomebody stops screaming long enough to say:\\nSOMEBODY (OS)\\nI\\'m sorry.  I can\\'t believe she \\nkilled me.  Who would\\'ve fuckin thought that?\\nCUT TO:11.}\\nINT. GETAWAY GAR (MOVING) - DAY 3 3\\nThe Somebody screaming is Mr. Orange.  He lies in the \\nbackseat.  He\\'s been SHOT in the stomach.  BLOOD covers both him and the backseat.\\nMr. White is the Somebody Else.  He\\'s behind the wheel of \\nthe getaway car.

ORANGE\\nLook, I don\\'t wanna be a fly in the ointment, but if help doesn\\'t come soon, I gotta see a doctor. I don\\'t give a fuck about jail, I just don\\'t wanna die.\\nMR.

You don\\'t have to take me in.  Just drive me up to the front, drop me on the sidewalk.  I\\'ll take care of myself.  I won\\'t tell them anything.

Spent from his outburst, he quietly mutters to himself:\\nMR. ORANGE (CONT’D)\\nTake me to a doctor, take me to a doctor, please.\\nSuddenly, the warehouse door BURSTS open and Mr. Pink steps inside.\\nMR.

PINK\\nOh this is bad, this is so bad.\\n(referring to Mr. Orange)\\nIs it bad?15.}\\nMR. WHITE\\nAs opposed to good?\\nMR. PINK\\nThis is so fucked up.  Somebody \\nfucked us big time.\\nMR. WHITE\\nYou really think we were set up?\\nMR. PINK\\nYou even doubt it?  I don\\'t think we got set up, I know we got set up!  I mean really, seriously, where did all those cops come from, huh?  One minute they\\'re not there, the next minute they\\'re there.  I didn\\'t hear any sirens.  The alarm went off, okay. Okay, when an alarm goes off, you got an average of four minutes response time.  Unless a patrol car is cruising that street, at that particular moment, you got four minutes before they can realistically respond.  In one minute there were seventeen blue boys out there.  All loaded for bear, all knowing exactly what the fuck they were doing, and they were all just there!  Remember that second wave that showed up in the cars? Those were the ones responding to the alarm.  but those other motherfuckers were already there, they were waiting for us.\\n(pause)\\nYou haven\\'t thought about this?\\nMR. WHITE\\nI haven\\'t had a chance to think. First I was just trying to get the fuck outta there.  And after we got away, I\\'ve just been dealin with him.\\nMR. PINK\\nWell, you better start thinking about it.  Cause I, sure as fuck, am thinking about it.  In fact, that\\'s all I\\'m thinking about.  I came this close to just driving off.  Whoever set us up, knows about this place.  16.}\\nThere could\\'ve been cops sitting \\nhere waiting for me.  For all we know, there\\'s cops, driving fast, on their way here now.\\nMR.

BATHROOM HALLWAY - DAY 5 5\\nAt the end of the hall is a bathroom.  The bathroom door is \\npartially closed, restricting our view.  Mr. Pink is obscured, but Mr. White is in view.\\nMR. PINK (OS)\\nWhat the fuck am I doing here?  I felt funny about this job right off.  As soon as I felt it I should said \"No thank you\", and walked.  But I never fucking listen.  Every time I ever got burned buying weed, I always knew the guy wasn\\'t right.  I just felt it.  But I wanted to believe him. If he\\'s not lyin to me, and it really is Thai stick, then whoa baby.  But it\\'s never Thai stick. and I always said if I felt that way about a job, I\\'d walk.  And I did, and I didn\\'t, because of fuckin money!\\nMR. WHITE\\nWhat\\'s done is done, I need you cool.  Are you cool?\\nMR. PINK\\nI\\'m cool.\\nMR. WHITE\\nSplash some water on your face. Take a breather.\\nWe hear the sink running, and Mr. Pink splashing water on his face.\\nMR. WHITE (CONT’D)\\nI\\'m gonna get me my smokes.\\nMr White opens the bathroom door, walks down the hall, and OUT OF FRAME.  We see Mr. Pink, his back turned towards us, bent over the sink.  17.}\\nThen he grabs a towels, and dries his face.  Mr White ENTERS \\nFRAME with a pack of Chesterfields in his hand.\\nMR. WHITE (CONT’D)\\nWant a smoke?\\nMR. PINK\\nWhy not?\\nThe two men light up.\\nMR. WHITE\\nOkay, let\\'s go through what happened.  We\\'re in the place, everything\\'s going fine.  Then the alarm gets tripped.  I turn around and all these cops are outside. You\\'re right, it was like, bam!  I blink my eyes are they\\'re there. Everybody starts going apeshit. Then Mr. Blonde starts shootin all the--\\nMR. PINK\\n--That\\'s not correct.\\nMR. WHITE\\nWhat\\'s wrong with it?\\nMR. PINK\\nThe cops didn\\'t show up after the alarm went off.  They didn\\'t show till after Mr. Blonde started shooting everyone.\\nMR. WHITE\\nAs soon as I heard the alarm, I saw the cops.\\nMR. PINK\\nI\\'m telling ya, it wasn\\'t that soon.  They didn\\'t let their presence be known until after Mr. Blonde went off.  I\\'m not sayin they weren\\'t there, I\\'m sayin they were there.  But they didn\\'t move in till Mr. Blonde became a madman.  That\\'s how I know we were set up.  You can see that, can\\'t you, Mr. White?\\nMR. WHITE\\nLook, enough of this \"Mr White\" shit--18.}\\nMR. PINK\\n--Don\\'t tell me your name, I don\\'t \\nwant to know!  I sure as hell ain\\'t gonna tell ya mine.\\nMR.

WHITE\\nUh-uh, just cops.\\nMR. PINK\\nCould you believe Mr. Blonde?\\nMR. WHITE\\nThat was one of the most insane fucking things I\\'ve ever seen. 20.}\\nWhy the fuck would Joe hire \\nsomebody like that?\\nMR. PINK\\nI don\\'t wanna kill anybody.  But if I gotta get out that door, and you\\'re standing in my way, one way of the other, you\\'re gettin outta my way.\\nMR. WHITE\\nThat\\'s the way I look at it.  A choice between doin ten years, and takin out some stupid motherfucker, ain\\'t no choice at all.  But I ain\\'t no madman either.  What the fuck was Joe thinkin?  You can\\'t work with a guy like that.  That mother- fucker\\'s unstable.  What do you think?  Do you think he panicked, or ya think he\\'s just trigger- happy?\\nMR. PINK\\nI think he\\'s a sick fuckin maniac! We\\'re awful goddamn lucky he didn\\'t tag us, when he shot up the place.  I came this fucking close--\\n(hold up two fingers and \\nmakes a tiny space between them)\\n--to taking his ass out myself. Everybody panics.  When things get tense, everybody panics. Everybody.  I don\\'t care what your name is, you can\\'t help it.  It\\'s human nature.  But ya panic on the inside.\\nYa panic in your head.  Ya give yourself a couple a seconds of panic, then you get a grip and deal with the situation.  What you don\\'t do, is shoot up the place and kill everybody.\\nMR. WHITE\\nWhat you\\'re supposed to do is act like a fuckin professional.  A psychopath is not a professional. You can\\'t work with a psychopath, \\'cause ya don\\'t know what those sick assholes are gonna do next. I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do you think that black girl was? Twenty, maybe twenty-one?21.}\\nMR. PINK\\nDid ya see what happened to anybody \\nelse?\\nMR. WHITE\\nMe and Mr. Orange jumped in the car and Mr. Brown floored it. After that, I don\\'t know what went down.\\nMR. PINK\\nAt that point it became every man for himself.  As far as Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue are concerned, I ain\\'t got the foggiest.  Once I got out, I never looked back.\\nMR. WHITE\\nWhat do you think?\\nMR. PINK\\nWhat do I think?  I think the cops caught them, or killed \\'em.\\nMR. WHITE\\nNot even a chance they punched through?  You found a hole.\\nMR. PINK\\nYeah, and that was a fucking miracle.  But if they did get away, where the fuck are they?\\nMR. WHITE\\nYou don\\'t think it\\'s possible, one of them got ahold of the diamonds and pulled a--\\nMR. PINK\\nNope.\\nMR. WHITE\\nHow can you be so sure?\\nMR. PINK\\nI got the diamonds.\\nMR. WHITE\\nWhere?\\nMR. PINK\\nI got \\'em, all right?\\nMR. WHITE\\nWhere?  Are they out in the car?22.}\\nMR. PINK\\nNo, they\\'re not in the car.  No, I \\ndon\\'t have them on me.  Ya wanna go with me and get \\'em?  Yes, we can go right now.  But first listen to what I\\'m telling you. We were fuckin set up!  Somebody is in league with the cops.  We got a Judas in our midst.  And I\\'m thinkin we should have our fuckin heads examined for waiting around here.\\nMR. WHITE\\nThat was the plan, we meet here.\\nMR. PINK\\nThen where is everybody?  I say the plan became null and void once we found out we got a rat in the house.  We ain\\'t got the slightest fuckin idea what happened to Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue.  They could both be dead\\nor arrested.  They could be sweatin \\'em, down at the station house right now.  Yeah they don\\'t know the names, but they can sing about this place. I mean, that could be happening right now.  As we speak, the cops could be in their cars, drivin here this minute.\\nMR. WHITE\\nI swear to god I\\'m fuckin jinxed.\\nMR. PINK\\nWhat?\\nMR. WHITE\\nTwo jobs back, it was a four man job, we discovered one of the team was an undercover cop.\\nMR. PINK\\nNo shit?\\nMR. WHITE\\nThank god, we discovered in time. We hadda forget the whole fuckin thing.  Just walked away from it.\\nMR. PINK\\nSo who\\'s the rat this time?  Mr. Blue?  Mr. Blonde?  Joe?  23.}\\nIt\\'s Joe\\'s show, he set this whole \\nthing up.  Maybe he set it up to set it up.\\nMR. WHITE\\nI don\\'t buy it.  Me and Joe go back a long time.  I can tell ya straight up, Joe definitely didn\\'t have anything to do with this bullshit.\\nMR. PINK\\nOh, you and Joe go back a long time.  I known Joe since I was a kid.  But me saying Joe definitely couldn\\'t have done it is ridiculous.  I can say I definitely didn\\'t do it, cause I know what I did or didn\\'t do.  But I can\\'t definitely say that about anybody else, \\'cause I don\\'t definitely know.  For all I know, you\\'re the rat.\\nMR. WHITE\\nFor all I know, you\\'re the rat.\\nMR.

WAREHOUSE - DAY 11 11\\nThey run over to Mr. Orange, who\\'s unconscious.  The CAMERA hovers over the action.  Mr. Pink reaches him first.\\nMR. PINK\\nIs he dead?\\nMr. White pushes him out of the way.  He feels the pulse on Mr. Orange\\'s neck.\\nMR. PINK (CONT’D)\\nSo, is he dead or what?\\nMR. WHITE\\nHe ain\\'t dead.24.}\\nMR. PINK\\nSo what is it?\\nMR. WHITE\\nI think he\\'s just passed out.\\nMR. PINK\\nHe scared the fuckin shit outta me.  \\nI thought he was dead fer sure.\\nMr. White stands up and walks over to a table.\\nMR. WHITE\\nHe will be dead fer sure, if we don\\'t get him to a hospital.\\nMR. PINK\\nWe can\\'t take him to a hospital.\\nMR. WHITE\\nWithout medical attention, this man won\\'t live through the night. That bullet in his belly is my fault.  Now while that might not mean jack shit to you, it means a helluva lot to me.  And I\\'m not gonna just sit around and watch him die.\\nMR. PINK\\nWell, first things first, staying here\\'s goofy.  We gotta book up.\\nMR. WHITE\\nSo what do you suggest, we go to a hotel?  We got a guy who\\'s shot in the belly, he can\\'t walk, he bleeds like a stuck pig, and when he\\'s awake, he screams in pain.\\nMR. PINK\\nYou gotta idea, spit it out.\\nMR. WHITE\\nJoe could help him.  If we can get in touch with Joe, Joe could get him to a doctor, Joe could get a doctor to come and see him.\\nDuring Mr. Pink\\'s dialog, we slowly ZOOM in to a C.U. of Mr. White.\\nMR. PINK (OS)\\nAssuming we can trust Joe, how we gonna get in touch with him?  25.}\\nHe\\'s supposed to be here, but he \\nain\\'t, which is making me nervous about being here.  Even if Joe is on the up and up, he\\'s probably not gonna be that happy with us. Joe planned a robbery, but he\\'s got a blood bath on his hands now. Dead cops, dead robbers, dead civilians...Jesus Christ!  I tend to doubt he\\'s gonna have a lot of sympathy for our plight.  If I was him, I\\'d try and put as much distance between me and this mess an humanly possible.\\nMR. WHITE\\nBefore you got here, Mr. Orange was askin me to take him to a hospital.  Now I don\\'t like turning him over to the cops, but if we don\\'t, he\\'s dead.  He begged me to do it.  I told him to hold off till Joe got here.\\nMR. PINK (OS)\\nWell Joe ain\\'t gettin here.  We\\'re on our own.  Now, I don\\'t know a goddamn body who can help him, so if you know somebody, call \\'em.\\nMR. WHITE\\nI don\\'t know anybody.\\nMR.

WHITE (OS)\\nHe asked.\\nMr. Pink looks at Mr. White like he\\'s retarded.\\nMR. WHITE (OS) (CONT’D)\\nWe had just gotten away from the cops.  He just got shot.  It was my fuckin fault he got shot.  He\\'s a fuckin bloody mess - he\\'s screaming.  I swear to god, I thought we was gonna die right then and there.  I\\'m tryin to comfort him, telling him not to worry, he\\'s gonna be okay, I\\'m gonna take care of him.  And he asked me what my name was.  I mean, the man was dyin in my arms. What the fuck was I supposed to tell him, \"Sorry, I can\\'t give out that information, it\\'s against the rules.  I don\\'t trust you enough.\"?  Maybe I shoulda, but I couldn\\'t.\\nMR. PINK\\nOh, I don\\'t doubt is was quite beautiful--\\nMR. WHITE (OS)\\nDon\\'t fuckin patronize me.\\nMR. PINK\\nOne question: Do they have a sheet on you, where you told him you\\'re from?\\nMR. WHITE (OS)\\nOf course.27.}\\nMR. PINK\\nWell that\\'s that, then.  I mean, I \\nwas worried about mug shot possibilities already.  But now he knows: (a) what you look like, (b) what your first name is, (i) where you\\'re from and (d) what your specialty is. They ain\\'t gonna hafta show him a helluva lot of pictures for him to pick you out.  That\\'s it right, you didn\\'t tell him anything else that could narrow down the selection?\\nMR.

And you, you motherfucker, are looking at me like it\\'s my fault.  I didn\\'t tell him my name.  I didn\\'t tell him where I was from.  I didn\\'t tell him what I knew better than to tell him.

He ain\\'t \\none of Cabot\\'s soldiers either. He\\'s gotta be from outta town. But Joe knows him real well.\\nHOLDAWAY\\nHow can you tell?\\nFREDDY\\nThe way they talk to each other. You can tell they\\'re buddies.\\nHOLDAWAY\\nDid the two of you talk?\\nFREDDY\\nMe and Mr. White?\\nHOLDAWAY\\nYeah.\\nFREDDY\\nA little.\\nHOLDAWAY\\nWhat about?\\nFREDDY\\nThe Brewers.\\nHOLDAWAY\\nThe Milwaukee Brewers?\\nFREDDY\\nYeah.  They had just won the night before, and he made a killing off \\'em.\\nHOLDAWAY\\nWell, if this crook\\'s a Brewers fan, his ass has gotta be from Wisconsin.  And I\\'ll bet you everything from a diddle-eyed Joe to a damned-if-I-know, that in Milwaukee they got a sheet on this Mr. White motherfucker\\'s ass.  I want you to go through the mugs of guys from old Milwaukee with a history of armed robbery, and put a name to that face.\\nHoldaway takes a big bite out of his burger.56.}\\nHOLDAWAY (CONT’D)\\n(with his mouth full)\\nWhat kinds questions did Cabot ask?\\nFREDDY\\nWhere I was from, who I knew, how I \\nknew Nice Guy, had I done time, shit like that.\\nHoldaway\\'s talked enough, he\\'s eating his burger now.  He motions for Freddy to elaborate.\\nFREDDY (CONT’D)\\nHe asked me if I ever done armed robbery before.  I read him my credits.  I robbed a few gas and sips, sold some weed, told him recently I held the shotgun while me and another guy pulled down a poker game in Portland.\\nCAMERA MOVES from a MEDIUM on Freddy to a CU.\\nHOLDAWAY (O.S.)\\nDidja use the commode story?\\nFREDDY\\nFuckin-A.

You remember what\\'s important, and the rest you make your own.  The only way to make it your own is to keep sayin it, and sayin it, and sayin it, and sayin it, and sayin it.\\nFREDDY\\nI can do that.\\nHOLDAWAY\\nThe things you gotta remember are the details.  It\\'s the details that sell your story.  Now this story takes place in this men\\'s room.  So you gotta know the details about this men\\'s room. You gotta know they got a blower instead of a towel to dry your hands.  You gotta know the stalls ain\\'t got no doors.  You gotta know whether they got liquid or powdered soap, whether they got hot water or not, \\'cause if you do your job when you tell your story, everybody should believe it.  And if you tell your story to somebody who\\'s actually taken a piss in this men\\'s room, and you get one detail they remember right, they\\'ll swear by you.58.}\\nINT.  FREDDY\\'S APARTMENT - DAY 29 29\\nFreddy paces back and forth, in and out of frame, rehearsing \\nthe anecdote.  He\\'s reading it pretty good, but he\\'s still reading it from the page, and every once in a while he stumbles over his words.\\nFREDDY\\n...this was during the Los Angeles marijuana drought of \\'86.  I still had a connection.  Which was insane, \\'cause you couldn\\'t get weed anyfuckinwhere then.  Anyway, I had a connection with this hippie chick up in Santa Cruz. All and my friends knew it.  And they\\'d give me a call and say, \"Hey, Freddy, you buyin some, you think you could buy me some too?\" They knew I smoked, so they\\'d ask me to buy a little for them when I was buyin.  But it got to be everytime I bought some weed, I was buyin for four or five different people.  Finally I said, \"Fuck this shit.\"  I\\'m makin this bitch rich.  She didn\\'t have to do jack shit, she never even had to meet these people.  I was fuckin doin all the work.  So I got together with her and told her, \"Hey, I\\'m sick of this shit.  I\\'m comin through for everybody, and nobody\\'s comin through for me. So, either I\\'m gonna tell all my friends to find their own source, or you give me a bunch of weed, I\\'ll sell it to them, give you the money, minus ten percent, and I get my pot for free.\"  So, I did if for awhile...\\nFreddy exits frame\\nCUT TO:\\nEXT.

When we move to a wider shot we see Freddy performing his monolog to Holdaway in a parking lot.  Holdaway sits on the hood of his beat-up car.  Freddy paces back and forth as he performs his story.59.}\\nFREDDY\\n...but then that got to be a pain \\nin the ass.  People called me on the phone all the fuckin time.  I couldn\\'t rent a fuckin tape without six phone calls interrupting me.  \"Hey, Freddy, when\\'s the next time you\\'re gettin some?\"  \"Motherfucker, I\\'m tryin to watch \\'Lost Boys\\'-- when I have some, I\\'ll let you know.\"  And then these rinky-dink pot heads come by--there\\'s my friends and everything, but still.  I got all my shit laid out in sixty dollar bags.  Well, they don\\'t want sixty dollars worth.  They want ten dollars worth.  Breaking it up is a major fuckin pain in the ass.  I don\\'t even know how much ten dollars worth is.  \"Well, fuck, man, I don\\'t want that much around.  If I have that much around I\\'ll smoke it.\"  \"Hey, if you guys can\\'t control your smokin, that\\'s not my problem. You motherfuckers been smokin for five years, be a adult about it.\" Finally I just told my connection, count me out.  But as it turns out, I\\'m the best guy she had, and she depended alot on my business. But I was still sick to death of it.  And she\\'s trying to talk me into not quitin.\\nNow this was a very weird situation, \\'cause I don\\'t know if you remember back in \\'86, there was a major fuckin drought. Nobody and anything.  People were livin on resin and smokin the wood in their pipes for months.  And this chick had a bunch, and was beggin me to sell it.  So I told her I wasn\\'t gonna be Joe the Pot Man anymore.  But I would take a little bit and sell it to my close, close, close friends.  She agreed to that, and said we\\'d keep the same arrangement as before, ten percent and free pot for me, as long as I helped her out that weekend.  She had a brick of weed she was sellin, and she didn\\'t want to go to the buy alone...\\nCUT TO:\\nINT.

She doesn\\'t want to walk around alone with all that weed.  Well, I don\\'t wanna do this, I have a bad feeling about it, but she keeps askin me, keeps askin me, finally I said okay \\'cause I\\'m sick of listening to it.  Well, we\\'re picking this guy up at the train station.\\nJOE\\nYou\\'re picking the buyer up at the train station?  You\\'re carrying the weed on you?\\nFREDDY\\nYeah, the guy needed it right away.  Don\\'t ask me why.  So we get to the train station, and we\\'re waitin for the guy.  Now I\\'m carrying the weed in one of those carry-on bags, and I gotta take a piss.

I tell \\'em, \"Freeze, don\\'t fuckin move.\" And the little idiot\\'s lookin at me, nodding his head \"Yes,\" sayin \"I know...I know...I know.\" Meanwhile his right hand is creepin towards his glove box.

E and Lois.  We called her Lady E.\\nMR. WHITE\\nWhere was she from, Compton?\\nEDDIE\\nNo.  She was from Ladora Heights.\\nMR. PINK\\nThe black Beverly Hills.

Anyway, this chick, Elois, was a man-eater-upper.  I bet every guy who\\'s ever met her has jacked off to her at least once.  You know who she looked like?  Christie Love.  \\'Member that TV show \"Get Christie Love\"?  She was a black female cop.  She always used to say \"You\\'re under arrest, sugar.\"\\nMR.

PINK\\nNo, it wasn\\'t Pan Grier, Pan Grier \\nwas the other one.  Pan Grier made the movies.  Christie Love was like a Pam Grier TV show, without Pam Grier.\\nMR. PINK (CONT’D)\\nWhat the fuck was that chick\\'s name?  Oh this is just great, I\\'m totally fuckin tortured now.\\nEDDIE\\nWell, whoever she was, Elois looked like her.  So one night I walk into the club, and no Elois. Now the bartender was a wetback, he was a friend of mine, his name was Carlos.\\nSo I asked him \"Hey, Carlos, where\\'s Lady E tonight?\"  Well apparently Lady E was married to this real piece of dog shit.  I mean a real animal.  And apparently he would so things to her.\\nFREDDY\\nDo things?  What would he do?  You mean like beat her up?\\nEDDIE\\nNobody knows for sure what he did. We just know he did something. Anyway, Elois plays it real cool. And waits for the next time this bag of shit gets drunk.  So one night the guy gets drunk and passes out on the couch.  So while the guy\\'s\\ninebriated, she strips him naked. Then she takes some crazy glue and glues his dick to his belly.\\nThe car reacts to how horrible that would be.\\nEDDIE (CONT’D)\\nI\\'m dead fuckin serious.

I\\'m Mr. Pink, let\\'s move on.\\nCAMERA leaves the team and goes to the blackboard with the layout of the jewelry store on it.\\nJOE (OS)\\nOkay fellas, let\\'s get into this.\\nCUT TO:\\nEXT. BLEACHERS - DAY 44 44\\nFreddy and Holdaway sit on some bleachers in an empty little league baseball field.\\nHOLDAWAY\\nOkay, we\\'re gonna station men across the street from Karina\\'s Fine Jewelry.  But their orders will be not to move in unless the robbery gets out of control.  You gotta make sure they don\\'t have to move in.  You\\'re inside to make sure that everything goes according to Hoyle.  We have men set up a block away from the warehouse rendezvous.  They got complete visibility of the exterior.  So as soon as Joe Cabot shows up, we\\'ll see it.\\nFREDDY\\nWhat\\'s your visibility of the interior?\\nHOLDAWAY\\nWe can\\'t see shit on the inside. And we can\\'t risk gettin any closer for fear they\\'ll spot us.77.}\\nFREDDY\\nThis is bullshit, Jim.  I get all \\nthe fuckin danger of having you guys in my back pocket but none of the safety.\\nHOLDAWAY\\nWhat\\'s the matter, Newendyke?  Job too tough for ya?  No one lied to you.  You always knew we\\'d hang back until Joe Cabot showed up.\\nFREDDY\\nOh this is great.  You ain\\'t giving me no fuckin protection whatsoever.  But you are giving me an attitude.\\nHOLDAWAY\\nSince when does an undercover cop have protection?  Freddy, you came into this thing with your eyes wide open, so don\\'t start screamin blind man now.  I understand you\\'re nervous.  I wish the warehouse had more visible windows, but it doesn\\'t.  We have to make do with the cards we\\'re dealt.\\nFREDDY\\nI didn\\'t say I wasn\\'t gonna do it. I\\'m just remarking on how shitty the situation is!\\nHOLDAWAY\\nI don\\'t mean to be harsh with ya, but I\\'ve found tough love works best in these situations.  We have to get Joe Cabot in the company of the thieves and in the same vicinity as the loot. We don\\'t care about these other bastards.  We\\'re willing to offer them good deals to testify against Cabot.\\nFREDDY\\nIsn\\'t this risk unorthodox?\\nHOLDAWAY\\nWhat?\\nFREDDY\\nLetting them go ahead with the robbery?78.}\\nHOLDAWAY\\nThe whole idea behind this \\noperation is to catch Joe Cabot red-handed.  We bust these hired hands, we ain\\'t accomplished shit. Letting them go through with the heist is a risk, but Cabot\\'s jobs are very clean.  We got people surrounding the perimeter.  We got a guy and a gal on the inside posing as a couple shopping for rings.  We could replace the employees with cops, but we\\'d run the risk of tipping \\'em off.\\nFREDDY\\nThat\\'s out.  They know the faces of who works what shift.\\nHOLDAWAY\\nThese guys are professionals. We\\'re professionals.  It\\'s a risk, but I think it\\'s a calculated risk.\\nEXT. KARINA\\'S FINE JEWELRY - DAY 45 45\\nWe see MOS SHOTS of the outside of the jewelry store.\\nCUSTOMERS coming and going.

WHITE\\'S CAR (PARKED) - DAY 46 46\\nMr. White and Freddy sit in a car parked across the street from the jewelry store, staking it out.\\nMR. WHITE\\nMyself and Mr. Pink?\\nFREDDY\\nYou two take the manager in the back and make him give you the diamonds.  We\\'re there for those stones, period.  Since no display cases are being fucked with, no alarms should go off.  We\\'re out of there in two minutes, not one second longer.  What if the manager won\\'t give up the diamonds?\\nMR. WHITE\\nWhen you\\'re dealing with a store like this, they\\'re insured up the ass.  They\\'re not supposed to give you and resistance whatsoever.  If you get a customer or an employee who thinks he\\'s Charles Bronson, take the butt of your gun and smash their nose in. Drops \\'em right to the floor. Everyone jumps, he falls down, screaming, blood squirts out his nose.  Freaks everybody out. Nobody says fuckin shit after that.  You might get some bitch talk shit to ya.  But give her a look, like you\\'re gonna smash her in the face next.  Watch her shut the fuck up.  Now if it\\'s a manager, that\\'s a different story. The managers know better than to fuck around.  So if one\\'s givin you static, he probably thinks he\\'s a real cowboy.  So what you gotta do is break that son-of-a- bitch in two.  If you wanna know something and he won\\'t tell you, cut off one of his fingers.  The little one.  Then you tell \\'im his thumb\\'s next.  80.}\\nAfter that he\\'ll tell ya if he \\nwears ladies underwear.  I\\'m hungry, let\\'s get a taco.\\nCUT TO:\\nEXT.

WHITE\\nObviously not enough.\\nEDDIE\\nFuck you! You gotta little black book, then whip is out.  If not, listen how it is.  I called three doctors and couldn\\'t get through to shit.  Now, time being a factor, I called Bonnie.  Sweet broad, helluva broad, and a registered nurse.  Told her a bullshit story, upside:  she said bring him to her apartment.\\nMR. WHITE\\nIf he dies I\\'m holding you personally responsible.\\nEDDIE\\nFuck you buddy boy!  Okay, you wanna play that way.  I am personally leaving myself vulnerable with this Bonnie situation.  I don\\'t think she\\'ll call the cops, but I don\\'t know for sure.  But me being too nice- a-fuckin-guy was willin to risk it.

He slashed the cop\\'s face, cut off his ear and was gonna burn him alive.85.}\\nEDDIE\\n(yelling)\\nWho cares what he was gonna do to \\nthis fuckin pig?\\nEddie whips out his gun and SHOOTS the cop.

WHITE\\n(to Eddie)\\nUhuh, uhuh, what\\'s I tell ya? That sick piece of shit was a stone cold psycho.\\nMR. ORANGE\\n(to Eddie)\\nYou could\\'ve asked the cop, if you didn\\'t just kill him.

Finally:\\nEDDIE\\nYou\\'re a fuckin liar.  Now why don\\'t you drop the fuckin fairy tale and tell me what really happened?\\nMR. WHITE (OS)\\nHe told you what really happened. You just can\\'t deal with it.\\nMR. ORANGE (OS)\\nOkay, you\\'re right, I\\'m lying. Even though I\\'m fuckin dyin I\\'m not above pullin a fast one.  Get rid of Blonde, we share his split - no, scratch that, I shot him \\'cause I didn\\'t like his hair style.  I didn\\'t like his shoes either.  If it has just been his hair, I\\'d\\'ve maybe, maybe I said, let him live.  But hair and footwear together, he\\'s a goner.\\nEDDIE\\nThe man you killed was just released from prison.  He got caught at a company warehouse full of hot items.  He could\\'ve walked away.  All he had to do was say my dad\\'s name.  But instead he shut his mouth and did his time.  He did four years for us, and he did \\'em like a man.  87.}\\nAnd we were very grateful.  So, Mr. \\nOrange, you\\'re tellin me this very good friend of mine, who did four years for my father, who in four years never made a deal, no matter what they dangled in front of him, you\\'re telling me that now, that now this man is free, and we\\'re making good on our commitment to him, he\\'s just gonna decide, right out of the fuckin blue, to rip us off?\\nSilence.\\nEDDIE (CONT’D)\\nMr. Orange, why don\\'t you tell me what really happened?\\nVOICE (OS)\\nWhy?  It\\'ll just be more bullshit.\\nEddie steps out of his C.U. and we see Joe Cabot standing in the warehouse doorway.

       " Document(page_content='Skip to content\\nToggle High Contrast\\n\\nMadam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \\n\\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \\n\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\n\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\n\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\n\\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\n\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\n\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\n\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\n\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland. \\n\\nIn this struggle as President Zelenskyy said in his speech to the European Parliament “Light will win over darkness.” The Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States is here tonight. \\n\\nLet each of us here tonight in this Chamber send an unmistakable signal to Ukraine and to the world. \\n\\nPlease rise if you are able and show that, Yes, we the United States of America stand with the Ukrainian people. \\n\\nThroughout our history we’ve learned this lesson when dictators do not pay a price for their aggression they cause more chaos.   \\n\\nThey keep moving.   \\n\\nAnd the costs and the threats to America and the world keep rising.   \\n\\nThat’s why the NATO Alliance was created to secure peace and stability in Europe after World War 2. \\n\\nThe United States is a member along with 29 other nations. \\n\\nIt matters. American diplomacy matters. American resolve matters. \\n\\nPutin’s latest attack on Ukraine was premeditated and unprovoked. \\n\\nHe rejected repeated efforts at diplomacy. \\n\\nHe thought the West and NATO wouldn’t respond. And he thought he could divide us at home. Putin was wrong. We were ready.  Here is what we did.   \\n\\nWe prepared extensively and carefully. \\n\\nWe spent months building a coalition of other freedom-loving nations from Europe and the Americas to Asia and Africa to confront Putin. \\n\\nI spent countless hours unifying our European allies. We shared with the world in advance what we knew Putin was planning and precisely how he would try to falsely justify his aggression.  \\n\\nWe countered Russia’s lies with truth.   \\n\\nAnd now that he has acted the free world is holding him accountable. \\n\\nAlong with twenty-seven members of the European Union including France, Germany, Italy, as well as countries like the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, and many others, even Switzerland. \\n\\nWe are inflicting pain on Russia and supporting the people of Ukraine. Putin is now isolated from the world more than ever. \\n\\nTogether with our allies –we are right now enforcing powerful economic sanctions. \\n\\nWe are cutting off Russia’s largest banks from the international financial system.  \\n\\nPreventing Russia’s central bank from defending the Russian Ruble making Putin’s $630 Billion “war fund” worthless.   \\n\\nWe are choking off Russia’s access to technology that will sap its economic strength and weaken its military for years to come.  \\n\\nTonight I say to the Russian oligarchs and corrupt leaders who have bilked billions of dollars off this violent regime no more. \\n\\nThe U.S. Department of Justice is assembling a dedicated task force to go after the crimes of Russian oligarchs.  \\n\\nWe are joining with our European allies to find and seize your yachts your luxury apartments your private jets. We are coming for your ill-begotten gains. \\n\\nAnd tonight I am announcing that we will join our allies in closing off American air space to all Russian flights – further isolating Russia – and adding an additional squeeze –on their economy. The Ruble has lost 30% of its value. \\n\\nThe Russian stock market has lost 40% of its value and trading remains suspended. Russia’s economy is reeling and Putin alone is to blame. \\n\\nTogether with our allies we are providing support to the Ukrainians in their fight for freedom. Military assistance. Economic assistance. Humanitarian assistance. \\n\\nWe are giving more than $1 Billion in direct assistance to Ukraine. \\n\\nAnd we will continue to aid the Ukrainian people as they defend their country and to help ease their suffering.  \\n\\nLet me be clear, our forces are not engaged and will not engage in conflict with Russian forces in Ukraine.  \\n\\nOur forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine, but to defend our NATO Allies – in the event that Putin decides to keep moving west.  \\n\\nFor that purpose we’ve mobilized American ground forces, air squadrons, and ship deployments to protect NATO countries including Poland, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. \\n\\nAs I have made crystal clear the United States and our Allies will defend every inch of territory of NATO countries with the full force of our collective power.  \\n\\nAnd we remain clear-eyed. The Ukrainians are fighting back with pure courage. But the next few days weeks, months, will be hard on them.  \\n\\nPutin has unleashed violence and chaos.  But while he may make gains on the battlefield – he will pay a continuing high price over the long run. \\n\\nAnd a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\n\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\n\\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\n\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\n\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\n\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \\n\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay. \\n\\nWhen the history of this era is written Putin’s war on Ukraine will have left Russia weaker and the rest of the world stronger. \\n\\nWhile it shouldn’t have taken something so terrible for people around the world to see what’s at stake now everyone sees it clearly. \\n\\nWe see the unity among leaders of nations and a more unified Europe a more unified West. And we see unity among the people who are gathering in cities in large crowds around the world even in Russia to demonstrate their support for Ukraine.  \\n\\nIn the battle between democracy and autocracy, democracies are rising to the moment, and the world is clearly choosing the side of peace and security. \\n\\nThis is a real test. It’s going to take time. So let us continue to draw inspiration from the iron will of the Ukrainian people. \\n\\nTo our fellow Ukrainian Americans who forge a deep bond that connects our two nations we stand with you. \\n\\nPutin may circle Kyiv with tanks, but he will never gain the hearts and souls of the Ukrainian people. \\n\\nHe will never extinguish their love of freedom. He will never weaken the resolve of the free world. \\n\\nWe meet tonight in an America that has lived through two of the hardest years this nation has ever faced. \\n\\nThe pandemic has been punishing. \\n\\nAnd so many families are living paycheck to paycheck, struggling to keep up with the rising cost of food, gas, housing, and so much more. \\n\\nI understand. \\n\\nI remember when my Dad had to leave our home in Scranton, Pennsylvania to find work. I grew up in a family where if the price of food went up, you felt it. \\n\\nThat’s why one of the first things I did as President was fight to pass the American Rescue Plan.  \\n\\nBecause people were hurting. We needed to act, and we did. \\n\\nFew pieces of legislation have done more in a critical moment in our history to lift us out of crisis. \\n\\nIt fueled our efforts to vaccinate the nation and combat COVID-19. It delivered immediate economic relief for tens of millions of Americans.  \\n\\nHelped put food on their table, keep a roof over their heads, and cut the cost of health insurance. \\n\\nAnd as my Dad used to say, it gave people a little breathing room. \\n\\nAnd unlike the $2 Trillion tax cut passed in the previous administration that benefitted the top 1% of Americans, the American Rescue Plan helped working people—and left no one behind. \\n\\nAnd it worked. It created jobs. Lots of jobs. \\n\\nIn fact—our economy created over 6.5 Million new jobs just last year, more jobs created in one year  \\nthan ever before in the history of America. \\n\\nOur economy grew at a rate of 5.7% last year, the strongest growth in nearly 40 years, the first step in bringing fundamental change to an economy that hasn’t worked for the working people of this nation for too long.  \\n\\nFor the past 40 years we were told that if we gave tax breaks to those at the very top, the benefits would trickle down to everyone else. \\n\\nBut that trickle-down theory led to weaker economic growth, lower wages, bigger deficits, and the widest gap between those at the top and everyone else in nearly a century. \\n\\nVice President Harris and I ran for office with a new economic vision for America. \\n\\nInvest in America. Educate Americans. Grow the workforce. Build the economy from the bottom up  \\nand the middle out, not from the top down.  \\n\\nBecause we know that when the middle class grows, the poor have a ladder up and the wealthy do very well. \\n\\nAmerica used to have the best roads, bridges, and airports on Earth. \\n\\nNow our infrastructure is ranked 13th in the world. \\n\\nWe won’t be able to compete for the jobs of the 21st Century if we don’t fix that. \\n\\nThat’s why it was so important to pass the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law—the most sweeping investment to rebuild America in history. \\n\\nThis was a bipartisan effort, and I want to thank the members of both parties who worked to make it happen. \\n\\nWe’re done talking about infrastructure weeks. \\n\\nWe’re going to have an infrastructure decade. \\n\\nIt is going to transform America and put us on a path to win the economic competition of the 21st Century that we face with the rest of the world—particularly with China.  \\n\\nAs I’ve told Xi Jinping, it is never a good bet to bet against the American people. \\n\\nWe’ll create good jobs for millions of Americans, modernizing roads, airports, ports, and waterways all across America. \\n\\nAnd we’ll do it all to withstand the devastating effects of the climate crisis and promote environmental justice. \\n\\nWe’ll build a national network of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations, begin to replace poisonous lead pipes—so every child—and every American—has clean water to drink at home and at school, provide affordable high-speed internet for every American—urban, suburban, rural, and tribal communities. \\n\\n4,000 projects have already been announced. \\n\\nAnd tonight, I’m announcing that this year we will start fixing over 65,000 miles of highway and 1,500 bridges in disrepair. \\n\\nWhen we use taxpayer dollars to rebuild America – we are going to Buy American: buy American products to support American jobs. \\n\\nThe federal government spends about $600 Billion a year to keep the country safe and secure. \\n\\nThere’s been a law on the books for almost a century \\nto make sure taxpayers’ dollars support American jobs and businesses. \\n\\nEvery Administration says they’ll do it, but we are actually doing it. \\n\\nWe will buy American to make sure everything from the deck of an aircraft carrier to the steel on highway guardrails are made in America. \\n\\nBut to compete for the best jobs of the future, we also need to level the playing field with China and other competitors. \\n\\nThat’s why it is so important to pass the Bipartisan Innovation Act sitting in Congress that will make record investments in emerging technologies and American manufacturing. \\n\\nLet me give you one example of why it’s so important to pass it. \\n\\nIf you travel 20 miles east of Columbus, Ohio, you’ll find 1,000 empty acres of land. \\n\\nIt won’t look like much, but if you stop and look closely, you’ll see a “Field of dreams,” the ground on which America’s future will be built. \\n\\nThis is where Intel, the American company that helped build Silicon Valley, is going to build its $20 billion semiconductor “mega site”. \\n\\nUp to eight state-of-the-art factories in one place. 10,000 new good-paying jobs. \\n\\nSome of the most sophisticated manufacturing in the world to make computer chips the size of a fingertip that power the world and our everyday lives. \\n\\nSmartphones. The Internet. Technology we have yet to invent. \\n\\nBut that’s just the beginning. \\n\\nIntel’s CEO, Pat Gelsinger, who is here tonight, told me they are ready to increase their investment from  \\n$20 billion to $100 billion. \\n\\nThat would be one of the biggest investments in manufacturing in American history. \\n\\nAnd all they’re waiting for is for you to pass this bill. \\n\\nSo let’s not wait any longer. Send it to my desk. I’ll sign it.  \\n\\nAnd we will really take off. \\n\\nAnd Intel is not alone. \\n\\nThere’s something happening in America. \\n\\nJust look around and you’ll see an amazing story. \\n\\nThe rebirth of the pride that comes from stamping products “Made In America.” The revitalization of American manufacturing.   \\n\\nCompanies are choosing to build new factories here, when just a few years ago, they would have built them overseas. \\n\\nThat’s what is happening. Ford is investing $11 billion to build electric vehicles, creating 11,000 jobs across the country. \\n\\nGM is making the largest investment in its history—$7 billion to build electric vehicles, creating 4,000 jobs in Michigan. \\n\\nAll told, we created 369,000 new manufacturing jobs in America just last year. \\n\\nPowered by people I’ve met like JoJo Burgess, from generations of union steelworkers from Pittsburgh, who’s here with us tonight. \\n\\nAs Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown says, “It’s time to bury the label “Rust Belt.” \\n\\nIt’s time. \\n\\nBut with all the bright spots in our economy, record job growth and higher wages, too many families are struggling to keep up with the bills.  \\n\\nInflation is robbing them of the gains they might otherwise feel. \\n\\nI get it. That’s why my top priority is getting prices under control. \\n\\nLook, our economy roared back faster than most predicted, but the pandemic meant that businesses had a hard time hiring enough workers to keep up production in their factories. \\n\\nThe pandemic also disrupted global supply chains. \\n\\nWhen factories close, it takes longer to make goods and get them from the warehouse to the store, and prices go up. \\n\\nLook at cars. \\n\\nLast year, there weren’t enough semiconductors to make all the cars that people wanted to buy. \\n\\nAnd guess what, prices of automobiles went up. \\n\\nSo—we have a choice. \\n\\nOne way to fight inflation is to drive down wages and make Americans poorer.  \\n\\nI have a better plan to fight inflation. \\n\\nLower your costs, not your wages. \\n\\nMake more cars and semiconductors in America. \\n\\nMore infrastructure and innovation in America. \\n\\nMore goods moving faster and cheaper in America. \\n\\nMore jobs where you can earn a good living in America. \\n\\nAnd instead of relying on foreign supply chains, let’s make it in America. \\n\\nEconomists call it “increasing the productive capacity of our economy.” \\n\\nI call it building a better America. \\n\\nMy plan to fight inflation will lower your costs and lower the deficit. \\n\\n17 Nobel laureates in economics say my plan will ease long-term inflationary pressures. Top business leaders and most Americans support my plan. And here’s the plan: \\n\\nFirst – cut the cost of prescription drugs. Just look at insulin. One in ten Americans has diabetes. In Virginia, I met a 13-year-old boy named Joshua Davis.  \\n\\nHe and his Dad both have Type 1 diabetes, which means they need insulin every day. Insulin costs about $10 a vial to make.  \\n\\nBut drug companies charge families like Joshua and his Dad up to 30 times more. I spoke with Joshua’s mom. \\n\\nImagine what it’s like to look at your child who needs insulin and have no idea how you’re going to pay for it.  \\n\\nWhat it does to your dignity, your ability to look your child in the eye, to be the parent you expect to be. \\n\\nJoshua is here with us tonight. Yesterday was his birthday. Happy birthday, buddy.  \\n\\nFor Joshua, and for the 200,000 other young people with Type 1 diabetes, let’s cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month so everyone can afford it.  \\n\\nDrug companies will still do very well. And while we’re at it let Medicare negotiate lower prices for prescription drugs, like the VA already does. \\n\\nLook, the American Rescue Plan is helping millions of families on Affordable Care Act plans save $2,400 a year on their health care premiums. Let’s close the coverage gap and make those savings permanent. \\n\\nSecond – cut energy costs for families an average of $500 a year by combatting climate change.  \\n\\nLet’s provide investments and tax credits to weatherize your homes and businesses to be energy efficient and you get a tax credit; double America’s clean energy production in solar, wind, and so much more;  lower the price of electric vehicles, saving you another $80 a month because you’ll never have to pay at the gas pump again. \\n\\nThird – cut the cost of child care. Many families pay up to $14,000 a year for child care per child.  \\n\\nMiddle-class and working families shouldn’t have to pay more than 7% of their income for care of young children.  \\n\\nMy plan will cut the cost in half for most families and help parents, including millions of women, who left the workforce during the pandemic because they couldn’t afford child care, to be able to get back to work. \\n\\nMy plan doesn’t stop there. It also includes home and long-term care. More affordable housing. And Pre-K for every 3- and 4-year-old.  \\n\\nAll of these will lower costs. \\n\\nAnd under my plan, nobody earning less than $400,000 a year will pay an additional penny in new taxes. Nobody.  \\n\\nThe one thing all Americans agree on is that the tax system is not fair. We have to fix it.  \\n\\nI’m not looking to punish anyone. But let’s make sure corporations and the wealthiest Americans start paying their fair share. \\n\\nJust last year, 55 Fortune 500 corporations earned $40 billion in profits and paid zero dollars in federal income tax.  \\n\\nThat’s simply not fair. That’s why I’ve proposed a 15% minimum tax rate for corporations. \\n\\nWe got more than 130 countries to agree on a global minimum tax rate so companies can’t get out of paying their taxes at home by shipping jobs and factories overseas. \\n\\nThat’s why I’ve proposed closing loopholes so the very wealthy don’t pay a lower tax rate than a teacher or a firefighter.  \\n\\nSo that’s my plan. It will grow the economy and lower costs for families. \\n\\nSo what are we waiting for? Let’s get this done. And while you’re at it, confirm my nominees to the Federal Reserve, which plays a critical role in fighting inflation.  \\n\\nMy plan will not only lower costs to give families a fair shot, it will lower the deficit. \\n\\nThe previous Administration not only ballooned the deficit with tax cuts for the very wealthy and corporations, it undermined the watchdogs whose job was to keep pandemic relief funds from being wasted. \\n\\nBut in my administration, the watchdogs have been welcomed back. \\n\\nWe’re going after the criminals who stole billions in relief money meant for small businesses and millions of Americans.  \\n\\nAnd tonight, I’m announcing that the Justice Department will name a chief prosecutor for pandemic fraud. \\n\\nBy the end of this year, the deficit will be down to less than half what it was before I took office.  \\n\\nThe only president ever to cut the deficit by more than one trillion dollars in a single year. \\n\\nLowering your costs also means demanding more competition. \\n\\nI’m a capitalist, but capitalism without competition isn’t capitalism. \\n\\nIt’s exploitation—and it drives up prices. \\n\\nWhen corporations don’t have to compete, their profits go up, your prices go up, and small businesses and family farmers and ranchers go under. \\n\\nWe see it happening with ocean carriers moving goods in and out of America. \\n\\nDuring the pandemic, these foreign-owned companies raised prices by as much as 1,000% and made record profits. \\n\\nTonight, I’m announcing a crackdown on these companies overcharging American businesses and consumers. \\n\\nAnd as Wall Street firms take over more nursing homes, quality in those homes has gone down and costs have gone up.  \\n\\nThat ends on my watch. \\n\\nMedicare is going to set higher standards for nursing homes and make sure your loved ones get the care they deserve and expect. \\n\\nWe’ll also cut costs and keep the economy going strong by giving workers a fair shot, provide more training and apprenticeships, hire them based on their skills not degrees. \\n\\nLet’s pass the Paycheck Fairness Act and paid leave.  \\n\\nRaise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and extend the Child Tax Credit, so no one has to raise a family in poverty. \\n\\nLet’s increase Pell Grants and increase our historic support of HBCUs, and invest in what Jill—our First Lady who teaches full-time—calls America’s best-kept secret: community colleges. \\n\\nAnd let’s pass the PRO Act when a majority of workers want to form a union—they shouldn’t be stopped.  \\n\\nWhen we invest in our workers, when we build the economy from the bottom up and the middle out together, we can do something we haven’t done in a long time: build a better America. \\n\\nFor more than two years, COVID-19 has impacted every decision in our lives and the life of the nation. \\n\\nAnd I know you’re tired, frustrated, and exhausted. \\n\\nBut I also know this. \\n\\nBecause of the progress we’ve made, because of your resilience and the tools we have, tonight I can say  \\nwe are moving forward safely, back to more normal routines.  \\n\\nWe’ve reached a new moment in the fight against COVID-19, with severe cases down to a level not seen since last July.  \\n\\nJust a few days ago, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—the CDC—issued new mask guidelines. \\n\\nUnder these new guidelines, most Americans in most of the country can now be mask free.   \\n\\nAnd based on the projections, more of the country will reach that point across the next couple of weeks. \\n\\nThanks to the progress we have made this past year, COVID-19 need no longer control our lives.  \\n\\nI know some are talking about “living with COVID-19”. Tonight – I say that we will never just accept living with COVID-19. \\n\\nWe will continue to combat the virus as we do other diseases. And because this is a virus that mutates and spreads, we will stay on guard. \\n\\nHere are four common sense steps as we move forward safely.  \\n\\nFirst, stay protected with vaccines and treatments. We know how incredibly effective vaccines are. If you’re vaccinated and boosted you have the highest degree of protection. \\n\\nWe will never give up on vaccinating more Americans. Now, I know parents with kids under 5 are eager to see a vaccine authorized for their children. \\n\\nThe scientists are working hard to get that done and we’ll be ready with plenty of vaccines when they do. \\n\\nWe’re also ready with anti-viral treatments. If you get COVID-19, the Pfizer pill reduces your chances of ending up in the hospital by 90%.  \\n\\nWe’ve ordered more of these pills than anyone in the world. And Pfizer is working overtime to get us 1 Million pills this month and more than double that next month.  \\n\\nAnd we’re launching the “Test to Treat” initiative so people can get tested at a pharmacy, and if they’re positive, receive antiviral pills on the spot at no cost.  \\n\\nIf you’re immunocompromised or have some other vulnerability, we have treatments and free high-quality masks. \\n\\nWe’re leaving no one behind or ignoring anyone’s needs as we move forward. \\n\\nAnd on testing, we have made hundreds of millions of tests available for you to order for free.   \\n\\nEven if you already ordered free tests tonight, I am announcing that you can order more from covidtests.gov starting next week. \\n\\nSecond – we must prepare for new variants. Over the past year, we’ve gotten much better at detecting new variants. \\n\\nIf necessary, we’ll be able to deploy new vaccines within 100 days instead of many more months or years.  \\n\\nAnd, if Congress provides the funds we need, we’ll have new stockpiles of tests, masks, and pills ready if needed. \\n\\nI cannot promise a new variant won’t come. But I can promise you we’ll do everything within our power to be ready if it does.  \\n\\nThird – we can end the shutdown of schools and businesses. We have the tools we need. \\n\\nIt’s time for Americans to get back to work and fill our great downtowns again.  People working from home can feel safe to begin to return to the office.   \\n\\nWe’re doing that here in the federal government. The vast majority of federal workers will once again work in person. \\n\\nOur schools are open. Let’s keep it that way. Our kids need to be in school. \\n\\nAnd with 75% of adult Americans fully vaccinated and hospitalizations down by 77%, most Americans can remove their masks, return to work, stay in the classroom, and move forward safely. \\n\\nWe achieved this because we provided free vaccines, treatments, tests, and masks. \\n\\nOf course, continuing this costs money. \\n\\nI will soon send Congress a request. \\n\\nThe vast majority of Americans have used these tools and may want to again, so I expect Congress to pass it quickly.   \\n\\nFourth, we will continue vaccinating the world.     \\n\\nWe’ve sent 475 Million vaccine doses to 112 countries, more than any other nation. \\n\\nAnd we won’t stop. \\n\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\n\\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\n\\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\n\\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\n\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\n\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\n\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\n\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\n\\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\n\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves. \\n\\nI’ve worked on these issues a long time. \\n\\nI know what works: Investing in crime preventionand community police officers who’ll walk the beat, who’ll know the neighborhood, and who can restore trust and safety. \\n\\nSo let’s not abandon our streets. Or choose between safety and equal justice. \\n\\nLet’s come together to protect our communities, restore trust, and hold law enforcement accountable. \\n\\nThat’s why the Justice Department required body cameras, banned chokeholds, and restricted no-knock warrants for its officers. \\n\\nThat’s why the American Rescue Plan provided $350 Billion that cities, states, and counties can use to hire more police and invest in proven strategies like community violence interruption—trusted messengers breaking the cycle of violence and trauma and giving young people hope.  \\n\\nWe should all agree: The answer is not to Defund the police. The answer is to FUND the police with the resources and training they need to protect our communities. \\n\\nI ask Democrats and Republicans alike: Pass my budget and keep our neighborhoods safe.  \\n\\nAnd I will keep doing everything in my power to crack down on gun trafficking and ghost guns you can buy online and make at home—they have no serial numbers and can’t be traced. \\n\\nAnd I ask Congress to pass proven measures to reduce gun violence. Pass universal background checks. Why should anyone on a terrorist list be able to purchase a weapon? \\n\\nBan assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. \\n\\nRepeal the liability shield that makes gun manufacturers the only industry in America that can’t be sued. \\n\\nThese laws don’t infringe on the Second Amendment. They save lives. \\n\\nThe most fundamental right in America is the right to vote – and to have it counted. And it’s under assault. \\n\\nIn state after state, new laws have been passed, not only to suppress the vote, but to subvert entire elections. \\n\\nWe cannot let this happen. \\n\\nTonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while you’re at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans can know who is funding our elections. \\n\\nTonight, I’d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer—an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service. \\n\\nOne of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court. \\n\\nAnd I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation’s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence. \\n\\nA former top litigator in private practice. A former federal public defender. And from a family of public school educators and police officers. A consensus builder. Since she’s been nominated, she’s received a broad range of support—from the Fraternal Order of Police to former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans. \\n\\nAnd if we are to advance liberty and justice, we need to secure the Border and fix the immigration system. \\n\\nWe can do both. At our border, we’ve installed new technology like cutting-edge scanners to better detect drug smuggling.  \\n\\nWe’ve set up joint patrols with Mexico and Guatemala to catch more human traffickers.  \\n\\nWe’re putting in place dedicated immigration judges so families fleeing persecution and violence can have their cases heard faster. \\n\\nWe’re securing commitments and supporting partners in South and Central America to host more refugees and secure their own borders. \\n\\nWe can do all this while keeping lit the torch of liberty that has led generations of immigrants to this land—my forefathers and so many of yours. \\n\\nProvide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, those on temporary status, farm workers, and essential workers. \\n\\nRevise our laws so businesses have the workers they need and families don’t wait decades to reunite. \\n\\nIt’s not only the right thing to do—it’s the economically smart thing to do. \\n\\nThat’s why immigration reform is supported by everyone from labor unions to religious leaders to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. \\n\\nLet’s get it done once and for all. \\n\\nAdvancing liberty and justice also requires protecting the rights of women. \\n\\nThe constitutional right affirmed in Roe v. Wade—standing precedent for half a century—is under attack as never before. \\n\\nIf we want to go forward—not backward—we must protect access to health care. Preserve a woman’s right to choose. And let’s continue to advance maternal health care in America. \\n\\nAnd for our LGBTQ+ Americans, let’s finally get the bipartisan Equality Act to my desk. The onslaught of state laws targeting transgender Americans and their families is wrong. \\n\\nAs I said last year, especially to our younger transgender Americans, I will always have your back as your President, so you can be yourself and reach your God-given potential. \\n\\nWhile it often appears that we never agree, that isn’t true. I signed 80 bipartisan bills into law last year. From preventing government shutdowns to protecting Asian-Americans from still-too-common hate crimes to reforming military justice. \\n\\nAnd soon, we’ll strengthen the Violence Against Women Act that I first wrote three decades ago. It is important for us to show the nation that we can come together and do big things. \\n\\nSo tonight I’m offering a Unity Agenda for the Nation. Four big things we can do together.  \\n\\nFirst, beat the opioid epidemic. \\n\\nThere is so much we can do. Increase funding for prevention, treatment, harm reduction, and recovery.  \\n\\nGet rid of outdated rules that stop doctors from prescribing treatments. And stop the flow of illicit drugs by working with state and local law enforcement to go after traffickers. \\n\\nIf you’re suffering from addiction, know you are not alone. I believe in recovery, and I celebrate the 23 million Americans in recovery. \\n\\nSecond, let’s take on mental health. Especially among our children, whose lives and education have been turned upside down.  \\n\\nThe American Rescue Plan gave schools money to hire teachers and help students make up for lost learning.  \\n\\nI urge every parent to make sure your school does just that. And we can all play a part—sign up to be a tutor or a mentor. \\n\\nChildren were also struggling before the pandemic. Bullying, violence, trauma, and the harms of social media. \\n\\nAs Frances Haugen, who is here with us tonight, has shown, we must hold social media platforms accountable for the national experiment they’re conducting on our children for profit. \\n\\nIt’s time to strengthen privacy protections, ban targeted advertising to children, demand tech companies stop collecting personal data on our children. \\n\\nAnd let’s get all Americans the mental health services they need. More people they can turn to for help, and full parity between physical and mental health care. \\n\\nThird, support our veterans. \\n\\nVeterans are the best of us. \\n\\nI’ve always believed that we have a sacred obligation to equip all those we send to war and care for them and their families when they come home. \\n\\nMy administration is providing assistance with job training and housing, and now helping lower-income veterans get VA care debt-free.  \\n\\nOur troops in Iraq and Afghanistan faced many dangers. \\n\\nOne was stationed at bases and breathing in toxic smoke from “burn pits” that incinerated wastes of war—medical and hazard material, jet fuel, and more. \\n\\nWhen they came home, many of the world’s fittest and best trained warriors were never the same. \\n\\nHeadaches. Numbness. Dizziness. \\n\\nA cancer that would put them in a flag-draped coffin. \\n\\nI know. \\n\\nOne of those soldiers was my son Major Beau Biden. \\n\\nWe don’t know for sure if a burn pit was the cause of his brain cancer, or the diseases of so many of our troops. \\n\\nBut I’m committed to finding out everything we can. \\n\\nCommitted to military families like Danielle Robinson from Ohio. \\n\\nThe widow of Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson.  \\n\\nHe was born a soldier. Army National Guard. Combat medic in Kosovo and Iraq. \\n\\nStationed near Baghdad, just yards from burn pits the size of football fields. \\n\\nHeath’s widow Danielle is here with us tonight. They loved going to Ohio State football games. He loved building Legos with their daughter. \\n\\nBut cancer from prolonged exposure to burn pits ravaged Heath’s lungs and body. \\n\\nDanielle says Heath was a fighter to the very end. \\n\\nHe didn’t know how to stop fighting, and neither did she. \\n\\nThrough her pain she found purpose to demand we do better. \\n\\nTonight, Danielle—we are. \\n\\nThe VA is pioneering new ways of linking toxic exposures to diseases, already helping more veterans get benefits. \\n\\nAnd tonight, I’m announcing we’re expanding eligibility to veterans suffering from nine respiratory cancers. \\n\\nI’m also calling on Congress: pass a law to make sure veterans devastated by toxic exposures in Iraq and Afghanistan finally get the benefits and comprehensive health care they deserve. \\n\\nAnd fourth, let’s end cancer as we know it. \\n\\nThis is personal to me and Jill, to Kamala, and to so many of you. \\n\\nCancer is the #2 cause of death in America–second only to heart disease. \\n\\nLast month, I announced our plan to supercharge  \\nthe Cancer Moonshot that President Obama asked me to lead six years ago. \\n\\nOur goal is to cut the cancer death rate by at least 50% over the next 25 years, turn more cancers from death sentences into treatable diseases.  \\n\\nMore support for patients and families. \\n\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\n\\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\n\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \\n\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\n\\nWe can do this. \\n\\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \\n\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\n\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\n\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\n\\nNow is the hour. \\n\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\n\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\n\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \\n\\nWell I know this nation.  \\n\\nWe will meet the test. \\n\\nTo protect freedom and liberty, to expand fairness and opportunity. \\n\\nWe will save democracy. \\n\\nAs hard as these times have been, I am more optimistic about America today than I have been my whole life. \\n\\nBecause I see the future that is within our grasp. \\n\\nBecause I know there is simply nothing beyond our capacity. \\n\\nWe are the only nation on Earth that has always turned every crisis we have faced into an opportunity. \\n\\nThe only nation that can be defined by a single word: possibilities. \\n\\nSo on this night, in our 245th year as a nation, I have come to report on the State of the Union. \\n\\nAnd my report is this: the State of the Union is strong—because you, the American people, are strong. \\n\\nWe are stronger today than we were a year ago. \\n\\nAnd we will be stronger a year from now than we are today. \\n\\nNow is our moment to meet and overcome the challenges of our time. \\n\\nAnd we will, as one people. \\n\\nOne America. \\n\\nThe United States of America. \\n\\nMay God bless you all. May God protect our troops. \\n\\n\\n', metadata={'source': 'state_of_the_union.txt'}),\n",

MELANIE\\'S BEAHC APARTMENT – NIGHT\\nThe Black Voice belong to forty-five-year old ORDELL ROBBIE .\\nOrdell wears clothes nice and likes wearing nice clothes. Stylish, athletic wear (Reebok), heavy,\\nblack leather jackets (Hugo Boss), warm-colored berets and baseball caps to cover his balding\\nhead are Ordell\\'s \"look.\" At this moment Ordell\\'s wearing an open silk shirt.\\nOrdell narrates the video playing on the big-screen V. (the most expensive thing in the\\napartment). He holds a cocktail in one hand (screwdriver, his drink of choice) and the remote\\ncontrol in the other, pacing the floor in his I-can-talk-anybody-into-anything voice.\\nLOUIS GARA , who looks like he does his shopping at the Salvation Army (dressed in a\\nHawaiian shirt and dungarees), sits on the sofa staring blankly at the video, drinking Jack\\nDaniels on ice. Louis, white, also in his mid forties, has lived over half of his life in penal\\ninstitutions. The experience has affected both his body language and his thought process.\\nWhile acutely aware of the rhythm of life inside a correction facility, in the real world his timing\\nis thrown. It\\'s like a song he doesn\\'t know the lyrics to but attempt to sing anyway.\\nThe third person watching the video is the person who lives in this apartment, MELANIE\\nRALSTON . Melanie, thirty-three, is a tanned, blonde, California beach bunny. Like the kind\\nyou se in the old Crown International movies from the seventies like \"Pom Pom Girls\" \"Malibu\\nBeach\" and \"Beach Girls,\" except Melanie is older than any of those girls ever are. She\\'s\\ndressed in her Melanie-uniform of stringy Levis cutoffs and a stringy bra top. So far Melanie\\nhas been able to make a living out of lying in the sun, always finding a generous, wealthy man\\nmore than willing to pay her rent and pick up her tabs. In her prime (twenty two) it was\\nJapanese industrialists, film production guys, and Middle Eastern businessmen who kept\\nMelanie. And it was places like the Bahamas, Acapulco, and the Virgin Islands where they kept\\nher.\\nBut now, at thirty three, she lives in an apartment in Hermosa Beach, California that Ordell\\npays for an drops in and out of. She\\'s curled up in a reclining chair, smoking weed from a pipe,\\nreading Movieline Magazine and paying no attention to the video.}\\nORDELL\\nThis TEC-9?

He closes the glovebox.\\nThe cab goes black.\\nEXT. OLDSMOBILE – NIGHT\\nThe Olds is parked out in the middle of some urban nowhere.\\nOrdell gets out, sticks the snubby in his pants, and walks to the back of the Olds.

He\\ngoes back into he trunk.\\nOrdell puts one more shot in his head, BAM, tosses the weapon on top of the dead body and\\ncloses the trunk.\\nOrdell\\'s Beaumont problem is solved.

She just says without expression;\\nJACKIE\\nI\\'m not a loser.\\nDARGUS\\nOh, you\\'re both? In 1985 you were flying for TWA and got\\nbusted for carrying drugs. You were carrying them for a\\npilot husband of yours. He did time and you got off. But\\nthat ended your career with the big airlines. Cut to thirteen\\nyears later. You\\'re forty-four years of age. You\\'re flying for\\nthe shittiest little shuttle-fucking piece of shit Mexican\\nairline that there is.

MAX\\'S CADILLAC – NIGHT\\nMax puts his key in the ignition, when Jackie asks;\\nJACKIE\\nAre you really a bail bondsman?\\nMAX\\nWho do you think I am?\\nShe doesn\\'t answer.\\nMAX (CONT\\'D)\\nI gave you my card there.\\nJACKIE\\nCan I see your I.D.?\\nMAX\\nYou\\'re serious?\\nShe waits.\\nMax digs the case out of his pocket, hands it to her, then reaches up and turns on the light\\nabove them for her to see.\\nMAX\\'S ID: SURETY AGENT LICENSED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA\\nJACKIE\\nWho put up my bond? Ordell?\\nMAX\\nIn cash.}\\nShe looks straight ahead.\\nMax shifts into drive.\\nMax rolls down his window at the front gate. A DEPUTY  comes out of the gatehouse and hands\\nthrough the window Max\\'s .38 revolver, cylinder opened. Max hands the Deputy his pass in\\nexchange for the gun, says \"thanks\", then puts the .38 in his glovebox in front of Jackie. He\\ndrives on.\\nMAX AND JACKIE (MOVING)\\nJACKIE\\nCan we stop for cigarettes?\\nMAX\\nSure, ever been to the Riverbottom?\\nJACKIE\\nI don\\'t think so.\\nMAX\\nIt\\'s okay. It\\'s a cop hangout.\\nJACKIE\\nCouldn\\'t we just stop at a seven-eleven?\\nMAX\\nI thought you might want a drink?\\nJACKIE\\nI\\'d love one, but not there.\\nMAX\\nWe could stop at the Hilton by the airport.\\nJACKIE\\nIs it dark?\\nMAX\\nIt\\'s kind of a sports bar\\nJACKIE\\nThat doesn\\'t sound dark.\\nMAX\\nWhy does it need to be dark?\\nJACKIE\\n\\'Cause I look like I just got outta jail, that\\'s why. You\\ndroppin\\' me off at home, right? There\\'s a place by me.\\nMAX\\nGreat.\\nCUT TO:}\\nEXT. THE COCKATOO INN – NIGHT\\nA big neon sign of a cockatoo sits on op of a red brick inn.\\nINT. THE COCKATOO INN – NIGHT\\nCLOSEUP – A KNOB is pulled out.\\nJackie picks up a pack of Mild Seven\\'s cigarettes from the bottom of a cigarette machine. She\\ncrosses the bar to join Max, sitting at a small table waiting for her to return.\\nThe Cockatoo Inn is just what Jackie was looking for. A dark and red cocktail lounge in\\nHawthorne off of Hawthorne Boulevard by the apartment where the stewardess lives (about ten\\nminutes from LAX)\\nThe clientele of the Cockatoo is an older, black crowd and an even older white crowd who\\'d\\nbeen coming here years before it became a black bar.\\nA JUKEBOX  plays soft, old-school R&B.\\nJackie and Max sit side by side at a small table, lit by a bar candle in a red glass thing.\\nMax drinks Bushmills over crushed ice. Jackie drinks white wine. Jackie opens her Mild\\nSevens, offering one to Max.\\nMAX\\nNo thanks, I quit three years ago.\\nAs she lights her cigarette.\\nJACKIE\\nYou gain weight?\\nMAX\\nTen pounds. I lose it and put it back on.\\nJACKIE\\nThat\\'s why I don\\'t quit. If I can\\'t fly anymore, I\\'m gonna\\nhave a bitch of a time gettin\\' my brand.\\nMAX\\nWhat\\'s your brand?\\nJACKIE\\nDavidoffs. I get \\'em in Mexico. They\\'re hard to find here. I\\nwas locked up with the last two getting legal advice from a\\nwoman who was in for bustin\\' her boyfriend\\'s head open\\nwith a baseball bat.\\nMAX\\nWas she helpful?}\\nJACKIE\\nShe was more helpful than the fuckin\\' Public Defender.\\n(she takes a sip of wine)\\nI don\\'t know – I guess what I need is a lawyer, find out\\nwhat my options are.\\nMAX\\nYou know, I figured out the other day I\\'ve written\\nsomething like\\' fifteen thousand bonds since I\\'ve been in the\\nbusiness. I\\'d say about eighty percent of them were at least\\ndrug related. If you want, I can help you look at your\\noptions.\\nJackie takes the talk in a different direction.\\nJACKIE\\nYou\\'re not tired of it?\\nMAX\\n(smiles)\\nI am, as a matter of fact.\\nA moment of silence between them, they both take drinks.\\nMAX (CONT\\'D)\\nWhat have they told you?\\nJACKIE\\nSo far I\\'ve been told I can cooperate and get probation,\\nmaybe. Or, I can stand mute and get as much as five years.\\nDoes that sound right?\\nMAX\\nI\\'d say if you\\'re tried and found guilty you won\\'t get more\\nthan a year and a day. That\\'s State time. Prison.\\nJACKIE\\n(under her breath)\\nShit.\\nMAX\\nBut they won\\'t want to take you to trial. They\\'ll offer you\\nsimple Possession, a few months of County time, and a year\\nor two probation.\\n(pointing to her drink)\\nHow \\'bout another?\\nJACKIE\\nSure.\\nMax gestures to an older black cocktail waitress named ROWEN  for two more.\\nMAX\\nYou know who put the dope in your bag?}\\nJACKIE\\nYeah, but that\\'s not what this was about. They were fuckin\\nwaitin\\' for my ass. They knew I had that money, they even\\nknew the amount. The one who searched my bag, from\\nL.A.P.D., Dargus, hardly even looked at it. \"Oh, I\\'d say\\nthere\\'s fifty thousand here. What would you say?\" But all\\nthey could do was threaten me and hand me over to\\nCustoms, and I could tell they didn\\'t want to do that.\\nMAX\\nThey wanted you to tell them what you know.\\nJACKIE\\nI had \\'em too. I burnt those two Starky and Hutch\\nmotherfuckers down. Then their asses lucked out and found\\nthat coke.\\nMAX\\nWhat did they want to know?\\nJACKIE\\nWho gave me the money and who I was giving it to. And\\nsome guy they found in a trunk with his head blown off.\\nSaid it was him who told them \\'bout me.\\nThe Waitress comes with the drinks.\\nROWEN\\nCan I get you two some popcorn?\\nMAX\\nNo, thanks.\\nRowen exits.\\nMAX (CONT\\'D)\\nThat would be Beaumont Livingston.\\nJACKIE\\nThat\\'s him. How do you know \\'em?\\nMAX\\nI wrote him on Monday. They found him dead on Tuesday.\\nJACKIE\\nOrdell pick up his bond?\\nMAX\\nSame as you. Ten thousand.\\nJACKIE\\nThe federal agent kinda half hinted Ordell might of done\\nBeaumont.\\nMAX\\nYou mentioned a guy from L.A.P.D., but you didn\\'t\\nmention the Federal.}\\nJACKIE\\nI didn\\'t?\\nMAX\\nNo, you didn\\'t. What branch?\\nJACKIE\\nRay Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.\\nMax puts it together.\\nMAX\\nHe\\'s the one who wants you.\\nJACKIE\\nIt was the other guy who busted me.\\nMAX\\n\\'Cause if he busted you, you\\'d play hell bonding out of\\nfederal court. He doesn\\'t want you mad at him, he wants\\nyou to tell him what you know. He uses you to get a line on\\nOrdell, make a case, then take him federal. You know what\\nOrdell\\'s into?\\nJACKIE\\nI have a pretty good idea. Ordell aint no bootlegger and I\\ndoubt he\\'s smugglin\\' Cuban cigars. So that only leaves one\\nthing an A.T.F. man would be interested in.\\nJackie waits a moment before answering, weighs things in her mind and makes a decision.\\nJACKIE\\nI used to bring over ten thousand at a time. That\\'s the legal\\nlimit, so I never brought more than that.\\nMAX\\nHow many trips did you make?\\nJACKIE\\nWith ten thousand? Nine.\\nMAX\\nHe\\'s got that kinda money?\\nJACKIE\\nIt\\'s all in lock boxes in a Mexico bank. But he\\'s got a\\nproblem. He\\'s – what do you call it when you got money,\\nbut don\\'t have cash?\\nMAX\\nCash poor?\\nJACKIE\\nThat\\'s it. He\\'s cash poor. He kept on me till I finally said\\nokay. I\\'ll bring whatever fits in a nine-by-twelve envelope. I\\ngot paid five hundred dollars, and his friend, Mr. Walker,\\nin Mexico gave me the envelope.}\\nMAX\\nIf you knew bringing anything over ten thousand was\\nagainst the law, why not pack a hundred grand?\\nJackie gets exasperated.\\nJACKIE\\nWhatever it was had to fit in my bag and not hit you in the\\nface if the bag was opened. This ain\\'t solvin\\' my problem. I\\ngotta figure out a way to either keep my job or get out of\\ntrouble. I\\'m of today, but if I can\\'t leave the country I\\'m\\nout of a job. And if I don\\'t got a job, I can\\'t hire a lawyer.\\nMAX\\nAsk A.T.F. They might give you permission.\\nJACKIE\\nYeah, if I cooperate.\\nMAX\\nWell, Jackie, you got caught, you\\'re gonna have to give \\'em\\nsomething.\\nJACKIE\\nBut if all I can give \\'em is Ordell\\'s name – I don\\'t really\\nknow shit about what he does or how he does it – That\\ndon\\'t give me much to bargain with.\\nMAX\\nGive \\'em what you got. Offer to help. Show a willingness to\\nbe helpful. You want to stay out of jail, don\\'t you?\\nMax looks at Jackie thinking about something.\\nMAX (CONT\\'D)\\nWhat\\'dya think?\\nCLOSEUP JACKIE\\nJACKIE\\nI think maybe I have more options than I thought.\\nDISSOLVE TO:\\nCLOSEUP: ORDELL\\nSitting in his black Mercedes, parked across the street from Jackie\\'s apartment building in\\nHawthorne. Johnny Cash is playing inside his car.}\\nEXT. JACKIE\\'S APARTMENT COMPLEX – NIGHT\\nORDELL\\'S POV\\nThrough the windshield, he sees Max\\'s powder-blue Cadillac Seville pull up to Jackie\\'s\\napartment. She gets out, ten bends down and talks to him through the window of the passenger\\nside door. Then makes a goobye gesture and turns, walking into her apartment complex. Max\\ndrives off.\\nORDELL\\nWhile Johnny Cash continues crooning, Ordell puts on his gloves. Then opens up his glovebox,\\ntaking out a little Targa .22 pistol. He steps out of the car, slipping the pistol into his coat\\npocket. We STEDICAM  in front of him as he walks across the street to Jackie\\'s apartment.\\nOnce inside the complex, Ordell passes us and WE FOLLOW BEHIND HIM , up to Jackie\\'s\\nground-floor apartment door.\\nHe gives it a soft knock with one knuckle. He waits a moment, then Jackie opens the door.\\nORDELL\\nHow you doing, Ms. Jackie?\\nJACKIE\\nI was expecting you. Come in.\\nJackie holds the door open for him.\\nINT. JACKIE\\'S APARTMENT – NIGHT\\nOrdell steps inside. He moves over by a halogen lamp in the living room.\\nORDELL\\nYou got some booze?\\nJackie still standing by the door. She doesn\\'t look frightened.\\nJACKIE\\nI got some vodka in the freezer.\\nORDELL\\nGot some o.j.?\\nJACKIE\\nYeah.\\nOrdell turns the halogen lamp to dim.\\nORDELL\\nWell, then, why don\\'t you be a good hostess and make me a\\nscrewdriver?\\nJACKIE\\nSure.}\\nJackie moves into the kitchen area. Ordell follows her, hanging in the doorway, while she\\nmakes the drink. Jackie doesn\\'t turn on the light.\\nORDELL\\nYou gonna thank me?\\nTaking a glass from the cupboard.\\nJACKIE\\nFor what?\\nORDELL\\nWho you think got your ass outta jail?\\nOpening the freezer and filling a glass with ice cubes and taking out vodka.\\nJACKIE\\nThe same guy who put me in, thanks a lot.\\nORDELL\\nHey, you get caught with blow, that\\'s our business.\\nOpens refrigerator, light cuts into the kitchen. She takes out orange juice, then closes the door.\\nJACKIE\\nIt wasn\\'t mine.\\nOrdell has to stop and think.\\nJackie makes screwdriver.\\nORDELL\\nOh, shit. I bet it was that present Mr. Walker was sending\\nMelanie. Yaaaah, he\\'s the one musta put it in there if you\\ndidn\\'t. Oh, man, that shit\\'s uncalled for, baby, and I\\napologize. I \\'magine they asked you a shitload of questions\\nabout it, huh? All that money, want to know where you got\\nit?\\nJackie doesn\\'t answer. She just walks up to Ordell handing him his yellow drink in the\\ndarkness. Ordell takes it, continues to look at Jackie.\\nORDELL (CONT\\'D)\\nI\\'magine they asked who you givin\\' it to, too.\\nJACKIE\\nThey asked.\\nORDELL\\nAnd what was your answer?\\nJACKIE\\nI said I wanted to talk to a lawyer.}\\nORDELL\\nYou positive about that? You weren\\'t nervous and let\\nsomething slip by mistake? If you did, I ain\\'t mad, I just\\ngotta know.\\nJackie says to his face;\\nJACKIE\\nYou\\'re not asking the right questions.\\nThen she walks past him back to the living room. She goes over to the halogen lamp, turning\\nthe light up brighter, then moves by the door, still standing and looking at Ordell in the kitchen\\ndoorway.\\nJACKIE\\nBeaumont Livingston.\\nORDELL\\nI knew it.\\nJACKIE\\nAnd they asked if I knew Mr. Walker.\\nOrdell by the halogen lamp. He turns it back to dim.\\nORDELL\\nYeah?\\nJACKIE\\nI didn\\'t tell \\'em anything.\\nOrdell moves slowly towards Jackie.\\nORDELL\\nMy name come up?\\nJackie slowly shakes her head \"no.\"\\nOrdell directly in front of Jackie, he gently places his gloved hands on her shoulders.\\nORDELL (CONT\\'D)\\nYou say anything about me?\\nJackie shakes her head \"no.\"\\nORDELL (CONT\\'D)\\nWell, that\\'s mighty honorable of you.\\nOrdell\\'s gloved fingertips move up her collarbone to her throat, gently touching her skin.

On the\\nLEFT-HAND SIDE  is Max driving home in his Seville.\\nMAX IN CAR\\nMax drives home, an almost moony romantic look no his face. He can\\'t stop thinking about\\nJackie. During the night she\\'d have a gleam in her eyes, the look saying; \"WE COULD HAVE\\nFUN\". Unless she was appraising kinda him with the look, making a judgment and what it said\\nwas; \"I COULD USE YOU\". Either way it was a turn-on.\\nMax pulls into the driveway of his small house in Torrance.\\nORDELL AND JACKIE\\nORDELL\\nYeah, somebody musta been real mad at Beaumont. Or\\nthey were afraid of what he might say to keep from doin\\nsome time. I\\'magine from time-to-time they asked you a\\nwhole shitload of questions. And you didn\\'t give \\'em no\\nanswer?\\nJackie shakes her head from side to side.\\nOrdell moves his thumbs from her collarbone to the middle of her throat.\\nORDELL\\nYou scared of me?\\nJackie shakes her head from side to side without her eyes leaving his. Reaches over the seat\\nORDELL\\nYou got a reason to be nervous with me?\\nWith his hands on Jackie\\'s throat, staring into the woman\\'s eyes, from BELOW FRAME  then\\nfeels something hard the fuck against his crotch. Neither break eye contact.\\nOrdell hears a CLICK.\\nCan\\'t believe it.\\nMAX IN CAR\\nMax takes his keys, then to the glove box...\\nTHE GLOVE BOX\\nThe gun is gone.}\\nMAX\\nWhere is it?\\nA CLOSEUP OF MAX\\'S GUN IN ORDELL ORDELL\\'S CROTCH\\nORDELL\\nIs that what I think it is?\\nJACKIE\\nWhat do you think it is?\\nCLOSEUP GUN IN CROTCH\\nORDELL\\nI think it\\'s a gun pressing against my dick.\\nJACKIE\\nYou thought right... Now take your hands from around my\\nthroat, nigga.\\nOrdell flashes his hustler\\'s smile and lets go.\\nEND OF SPLIT SCREEN\\nJackie turns Ordell around, gun firmly in his back, and pushes him against the wall.\\nORDELL\\nWhat the hell you doin\\'?\\nJACKIE\\nShut your ass up and grab the wall!\\nJackie has Ordell against the wall and is frisking him the way a cop would. She finds the .22\\npistol in his pocket\\nORDELL\\nNow, baby, that\\'s got nothin\\' to do with you. I just carry\\nthat. You been listenin\\' to them cops too much.\\nJACKIE\\nThe cops didn\\'t try and strangle my ass.\\nORDELL\\nDamn, Jackie, I was just playin\\' with you.\\nJACKIE\\nWell, I ain\\'t playin with you.

Ordell still tries bullshit...\\nORDELL\\nI\\'m tellin\\' you, those cops been fuckin\\' wit your mind.

I\\'ll go get it.\\nShe leaves FRAME , and Max enters it, closing the door behind him. Max stands by the door, a\\nlittle surprised and a touch pissed at the nonchalantness.\\nAs he stands on the threshold to her living room, waiting for her to return with the gun, feeling\\nfoolish, he thinks about hauling her ass back to the stockade. That\\'ll change her expression,\\nhe\\'d bet.\\nShe returns from the bedroom, gun in hand, wearing a sort of sad smile.\\nJACKIE (CONT\\'D)\\nMax, I\\'m sorry. I was afraid if I asked to borrow it you\\'d\\nsay no. You\\'d have to. Would you like some coffee?\\nThen, as quickly as the anger rose in Max, it dissipates completely, leaving only curiosity.\\nMAX\\nIf you\\'re having some.\\nJACKIE\\nI am. Have a seat.\\nJackie head to the kitchen, making the coffee. Max sits at the dining table off of the kitchen.\\nMAX\\nYou get a chance to use it?\\nJACKIE\\nI felt a lot safer having it. My milk went bad when I was in\\njail.\\nMAX\\nBlack\\'s fine.\\nShe puts a finger in the coffeemaker and starts scooping coffee in it.\\nMAX (CONT\\'D)\\nYou want to hang on to it awhile? It wouldn\\'t be legal, but\\nif it makes –\\nJackie goes to the sink, filling the coffee pot.}\\nJACKIE\\nThanks, but I have my own now.\\nMAX\\nYou went out this morning and bought a gun?\\nShe turns off the water.\\nJACKIE\\nWhat, I couldn\\'t hear you?\\nMAX\\nYou went out this morning and bought a gun.\\nPouring water into the coffee machine.\\nJACKIE\\nLet\\'s just say I got one, okay?\\nShe turns on the coffeemaker.\\nMAX\\nSomebody loan it to you?\\nJACKIE\\nYeah.\\nJackie leaves the kitchen.\\nMax\\'s eyes follow her to the living room.\\nJACKIE (CONT\\'D)\\nWant to hear some music?\\nMAX\\nSure.\\nJackie ends her knees and goes through a stack of records leaned up against the wall on the\\nfloor.\\nJACKIE\\nI couldn\\'t wait till I got home last night and wash my hair.\\nMAX\\nIt looks nice.\\nShe finds a record, takes it out of the pile, removes the album from the sleeve, and places it on\\nher stereo turntable.\\nMAX (CONT\\'D)\\nYou never got into the whole CD revolution?\\nJACKIE\\nI got a few. But I can\\'t afford to start all over again. I got\\ntoo much time and money invested in my records.\\nThe song starts; it\\'s an old romantic soul music number from the early seventies.}\\nMAX\\nYeah, but you can\\'t get new stuff on records.\\nJackie picks up her cigarettes off the coffee table.\\nJACKIE\\nI don\\'t buy new stuff that often.\\nJackie enters the kitchen door frame by Max.

As far as the airline knows,\\nI\\'m still available.\\nMAX\\nAre you?\\nJACKIE\\nI don\\'t know yet. \\'m going to talk with Dargus and Nicolet\\ntoday. Do what you suggested. Offer to help and see what\\nhappens.\\nMAX\\nWhat I meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you.\\nJACKIE\\nI want to talk to them first. I know more now about\\nOrdell\\'s money.\\nMAX\\nWell, if the A.T.F. guy is the one who wants you, that\\'ll only\\ninterest him up to a point.}\\nJACKIE\\nIt\\'s a lot of money. About a half-a-million dollars. All of it\\nin Cabo in safe deposit boxes and more comin in.\\nMAX\\nHow\\'d you find that out?\\nJACKIE\\nHe told me last night.\\nMAX\\nHe called you?\\nJACKIE\\nHe came by.\\nMAX\\nWhat?... What\\'d you do?\\nJACKIE\\nWe talked.\\nJackie goes back in the kitchen. Coffee\\'s almost there, but not quite. She pulls down two mugs\\nfrom a cabinet.\\nJACKIE (CONT\\'D)\\nHe had his doubts at first. But he\\'s always trusted me an\\nwants more than anything to believe he still can.\\nMAX\\nWhy?\\nJACKIE\\nHe needs me. Without me all that money is just gonna sit\\nover there in Cabo. Sugar?\\nMAX\\nNo thanks. There\\'s gotta be other ways to get it out.\\nShe pours the coffee.\\nJACKIE\\nMaybe, but \\'m the only one he\\'s ever used. He can\\'t trust\\nhis other people. They\\'re crooks. He can try bringing I in\\nhimself, but Ordell sure don\\'t want to go through no\\nCustoms line. Either he recruits another Cabo stewardess,\\nor he continues to trust me. I made him feel he still can.\\nJackie walks to the table with the two coffee mugs and sits down.\\nMAX\\nHow do you get it out?\\nJACKIE\\nSame way I been don\\', but first they got to let me go back to\\nwork.}\\nMAX\\nYou\\'re gonna offer to set him up?\\nJACKIE\\nIf I get let off. Otherwise, fuck \\'em.\\nMAX\\nIt\\'s very possible Ordell\\'s killed somebody.\\nJACKIE\\nI ain\\'t goin\\' to jail, and I ain\\'t doin\\' that probation thing\\nagain.\\nMax watches her a moment\\nJackie takes a drink of coffee.\\nJACKIE (CONT\\'D)\\nHow do you feel about getting old?\\nMAX\\nYou\\'re not old. You look great.\\nJACKIE\\nI\\'m asking how you feel. Does it bother you?\\nMAX\\nIt\\'s not really something I think about.\\nJACKIE\\nReally?\\nMAX\\nOkay, I\\'m a little sensitive about my hair. It started falling\\nout ten years ago. So I did something about it.\\nJACKIE\\nHow\\'d you feel about it?\\nMAX\\nI\\'m fine with it, or I wouldn\\'t of done it, I did it to feel\\nbetter about myself, and I do. When I look in the mirror it\\nlooks like me.\\nJACKIE\\nIt\\'s different with men.\\nMAX\\nYou know, I can\\'t really feel too sorry for you in that\\ndepartment.\\nJackie smiles.\\nMAX (CONT\\'D)\\nIn fact, I\\'d make a bet that except possibly for an Afro –\\nyou look exactly the same as you did at twenty nine.}\\nJackie smiles into her coffee.\\nJACKIE\\nMy ass ain\\'t the same.\\nMAX\\nBigger?\\nJACKIE\\nYeah.\\nMax smiles.\\nMAX\\nNothin wrong with that.\\nJackie\\'s smile grows bigger.\\nMAX (CONT\\'D)\\nDoes something else worry you?\\nJACKIE\\nI just feel like I\\'m always starting over. You said how many\\nbonds you wrote?\\nMAX\\nFifteen thousand.\\nJACKIE\\nWell, I\\'ve flown seven million miles. And I\\'ve been waitin\\'\\non people almost twenty years. The best job I could get\\nafter my bust was Cabo Air, which is about the worst job\\nyou can get in this industry. I make about sixteen thousand,\\nwith retirement benefits , ain\\'t worth a damn. And now\\nwith this arrest hanging over my head, I\\'m scared. If I lose\\nmy job I gotta start all over again, but I got nothin to start\\nover with. I\\'ll be stuck with whatever I can get.

Put the money in a\\nshopping bag and hand it to someone I meet here.\\nMAX\\nYou don\\'t actually do it that way?\\nJACKIE\\nHe always just picked it up at my place. But with A.T.F.\\ninvolved, I want to stage it. You know, make it look more\\nintriguing, like we know what the fuck we\\'re doin\\'. Then\\nit\\'s up to Ray Nicolet, the A.T.

That\\'s what\\nhe calls it. A sting. He\\'s being real nice to me.\\nMAX\\nYou think he\\'s got a thing for you?\\nJACKIE\\nMaybe. But I\\'m thinking it might be something like he\\nwants the money for himself.\\nMAX\\nI don\\'t follow your logic. What does his being nice to you\\nhave to do with him wanting Ordell\\'s money?}\\nJACKIE\\nHe\\'s setting me up to make a proposition.\\nMAX\\nI see.\\nJACKIE\\nYou don\\'t propose something like that unless you\\'re pretty\\nsure the other person\\'s into it.\\nMAX\\nHas he hinted around?\\nJACKIE\\nNot really. But I knew this narcotics cop one time. Told me\\nthat in a raid, the whole package never gets back to the\\nstation. His exact words.\\nMAX\\nYou know some interesting people.\\nJACKIE\\nWe weren\\'t bullshittin\\' either, \\'cause later he was\\nsuspended and forced to retire.\\nMAX\\nHas Nicolet told you any colorful stories like that?\\nShe shakes her head \"no.\"\\nJACKIE\\nHe tries to act cool.\\nMAX\\nNo harm in that. He\\'s a young guy havin\\' fun being a cop. I\\nknow the type, trust me on this. He\\'s more interested in\\nOrdell than the money. If he\\'s gonna do anything suspect,\\nit\\'ll be cutting corners to get the conviction; but he\\nwouldn\\'t walk off with the money. It\\'s evidence.\\nJACKIE\\nWhat about you Max?\\nMAX\\nWhat? If I was in Nicolet\\'s place?\\nJACKIE\\nNo, I mean you, right now. Not it you were somebody else.\\nMAX\\nIf I saw a way to walk off with a shopping bag full of\\nmoney, would I take it?\\nJACKIE\\nYou know where it came from.

It wouldn\\'t even be missed.}\\nMAX\\nA half-a-million dollars will always be missed.\\nJACKIE\\nYou\\'re avoiding the question.\\nMAX\\nOkay, sure. I might be tempted. Especially now, since I\\'m\\ngetting out of the bail bonds business.\\nJackie looks at him, \"wow, that was a statement,\" but she doesn\\'t say anything.\\nMax continues.\\nMAX\\nI have to stand behind all my active bonds, but I\\'m not\\nwriting any new ones.\\nJACKIE\\nWhy?\\nMAX\\nA lot of reasons. But the main one would be I\\'m tired of it.\\nJACKIE\\nWhen did you decide?\\nMAX\\nIt\\'s been a long time coming. I finally made up my mind – I\\nguess it was Thursday.\\nFLASH ON:\\nA RELEASE FORM\\nWith a date on it. Jackie\\'s hand is signing her name. We WHIP UP  and se her face, just as Max\\nCherry approaches her, handing her his business card.\\nMAX\\nHi, I\\'m Max Cherry.

I hear he\\'s staying\\nat this house, so I sneak in, wait for him to come home.\\nJACKIE\\nWait a minute.

JACKIE\\'S APARTMENT – NIGHT\\nMax sits on the couch in Jackie\\'s apartment drinking white wine.\\nJackie paces in front of him, white wine in one hand, Davidoff in the other, going over the\\ndetails of tomorrow. One could notice a slight change in Jackie.\\nThere\\'s a bit of an edge to Miss Brown that\\'s bubbling underneath her cool surface. It\\'s\\nunderstandable. After all, she\\'s been the architect of this half-a-million dollars switcheroo.\\nShe\\'s moved heaven and earth to make all the pieces fall into place, and all the players thnk\\nwhat she wants them to think.\\nAs she talks to Max she knows tomorrow all her hard work will either fail or succeed. But don\\'t\\ntake this difference the wrong way. This edge I\\'m referring to is not one born out of fear\\n(Jackie\\'s nervous, but she\\'s not afraid). It\\'s more the edge an athlete might feel before an all-\\nimportant competition.\\nJACKIE\\nI told them Ordell\\'s changed the amount he\\'s bringing in.\\nMAX\\nDo you think they bought it?\\nJACKIE\\nOh, yeah. I got them thinking Ordell\\'s real nervous.

The idea was to try on the suit,\\nsee if I liked it. If I did, get them to wrap it up, and change\\nback into my uniform. That\\'s what Sheronda\\'s expecting\\nme to wear. Go meet Sheronda, give her the bag with fifty\\nthousand, and go home.\\nNICOLET\\nBut you didn\\'t do that.\\nJACKIE\\nBecause I didn\\'t have it.

COFFEE SHOP – MORNING\\nA normal Denny\\'s, Spires-like coffee shop in Los Angeles. It\\'s\\nabout 9:00 in the morning. While the place isn\\'t jammed, there\\'s a\\nhealthy number of people drinking coffee, munching on bacon and\\neating eggs.\\nTwo of these people are a YOUNG MAN and a YOUNG WOMAN. The Young\\nMan has a slight working-class English accent and, like his fellow\\ncountryman, smokes cigarettes like they\\'re going out of style.\\nIt is impossible to tell where the Young Woman is from or how old\\nshe is; everything she does contradicts something she did. The boy\\nand girl sit in a booth. Their dialogue is to be said in a rapid-\\npace \"HIS GIRL FRIDAY\" fashion.\\nYOUNG MAN\\nNo, forget it, it\\'s too risky. I\\'m through\\ndoin\\' that shit.\\nYOUNG WOMAN\\nYou always say that, the same thing every\\ntime: never again, I\\'m through, too\\ndangerous.\\nYOUNG MAN\\nI know that\\'s what I always say. I\\'m\\nalways right too, but –\\nYOUNG WOMAN\\n– but you forget about it in a day or two\\n–\\nYOUNG MAN\\n– yeah, well, the days of me forgittin\\'\\nare over, and the days of me rememberin\\'\\nhave just begun.\\nYOUNG WOMAN\\nWhen you go on like this, you know what\\nyou sound like?\\nYOUNG MAN\\nI sound like a sensible fucking man, is\\nwhat I sound like.}\\nYOUNG WOMAN\\nYou sound like a duck.\\n(imitates a duck)\\nQuack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack,\\nquack...\\nYOUNG MAN\\nWell take heart, \\'cause you\\'re never gonna\\nhafta hear it again. Because since I\\'m\\nnever gonna do it again, you\\'re never\\ngonna hafta hear me quack about how I\\'m\\nnever gonna do it again.\\nYOUNG WOMAN\\nAfter tonight.\\nThe boy and girl laugh, their laughter putting a pause in there,\\nback and forth.\\nYOUNG MAN\\n(with a smile)\\nCorrect. I got all tonight to quack.\\nA WAITRESS comes by with a pot of coffee.\\nWAITRESS\\nCan I get anybody anymore coffee?\\nYOUNG WOMAN\\nOh yes, thank you.\\nThe Waitress pours the Young Woman\\'s coffee. The Young Man lights\\nup another cigarette.\\nYOUNG MAN\\nI\\'m doin\\' fine.\\nThe Waitress leaves. The Young Man takes a drag off of his smoke.\\nThe Young Woman pours a ton of cream and sugar into her coffee.\\nThe Young Man goes right back into it.\\nYOUNG MAN\\nI mean the way it is now, you\\'re takin\\'\\nthe same fuckin\\' risk as when you rob a\\nbank. You take more of a risk. Banks are\\neasier! Federal banks aren\\'t supposed to\\nstop you anyway, during a robbery. They\\'re\\ninsured, why should they care? You don\\'t\\neven need a gun in a federal bank. I heard\\nabout this guy, walked into a federal bank\\nwith a portable phone, handed the phone to\\nthe teller, the guy on the other end of\\nthe phone said: \"We got this guy\\'s little\\ngirl, and if you don\\'t give him all your\\nmoney, we\\'re gonna kill \\'er.\"\\nYOUNG WOMAN\\nDid it work?}\\nYOUNG MAN\\nFuckin\\' A it worked, that\\'s what I\\'m\\ntalkin\\' about! Knucklehead walks in a bank\\nwith a telephone, not a pistol, not a\\nshotgun, but a fuckin\\' phone, cleans the\\nplace out, and they don\\'t lift a fuckin\\'\\nfinger.\\nYOUNG WOMAN\\nDid they hurt the little girl?\\nYOUNG MAN\\nI don\\'t know. There probably never was a\\nlittle girl – the point of the story isn\\'t\\nthe little girl. The point of the story is\\nthey robbed the bank with a telephone.\\nYOUNG WOMAN\\nYou wanna rob banks?\\nYOUNG MAN\\nI\\'m not sayin\\' I wanna rob banks, I\\'m just\\nillustrating that if we did, it would be\\neasier than what we been doin\\'.\\nYOUNG WOMAN\\nSo you don\\'t want to be a bank robber?\\nYOUNG MAN\\nNaw, all those guys are goin\\' down the\\nsame road, either dead or servin\\' twenty.\\nYOUNG WOMAN\\nAnd no more liquor stores?\\nYOUNG MAN\\nWhat have we been talking about? Yeah, no-\\nmore-liquor-stores. Besides, it ain\\'t the\\ngiggle it usta be. Too many foreigners own\\nliquor stores. Vietnamese, Koreans, they\\ncan\\'t fuckin\\' speak English. You tell \\'em:\\n\"Empty out the register,\" and they don\\'t\\nknow what it fuckin\\' means. They make it\\ntoo personal. We keep on, one of those\\ngook motherfuckers\\' gonna make us kill\\n\\'em.\\nYOUNG WOMAN\\nI\\'m not gonna kill anybody.}\\nYOUNG MAN\\nI don\\'t wanna kill anybody either. But\\nthey\\'ll probably put us in a situation\\nwhere it\\'s us of them. And if it\\'s not the\\ngooks, it these old Jews who\\'ve owned the\\nstore for fifteen fuckin\\' generations. Ya\\ngot Grandpa Irving sittin\\' behind the\\ncounter with a fuckin\\' Magnum. Try walkin\\'\\ninto one of those stores with nothin\\' but\\na telephone, see how far it gets you. Fuck\\nit, forget it, we\\'re out of it.\\nYOUNG WOMAN\\nWell, what else is there, day jobs?\\nYOUNG MAN\\n(laughing)\\nNot this life.\\nYOUNG WOMAN\\nWell what then?\\nHe calls to the Waitress.\\nYOUNG MAN\\nGarcon! Coffee!\\nThen looks to his girl.\\nYOUNG MAN\\nThis place.\\nThe Waitress comes by, pouring him some more.\\nWAITRESS\\n(snotty)\\n\"Garcon\" means boy.\\nShe splits.\\nYOUNG WOMAN\\nHere? It\\'s a coffee shop.\\nYOUNG MAN\\nWhat\\'s wrong with that? People never rob\\nrestaurants, why not? Bars, liquor stores,\\ngas stations, you get your head blown off\\nstickin\\' up one of them. Restaurants, on\\nthe other hand, you catch with their pants\\ndown. They\\'re not expecting to get robbed,\\nor not as expecting.\\nYOUNG WOMAN\\n(taking to idea)\\nI bet in places like this you couldcut\\ndown on the hero factor.}\\nYOUNG MAN\\nCorrect. Just like banks, these places are\\ninsured. The managers don\\'t give a fuck,\\nthey\\'re just tryin\\' to get ya out the door\\nbefore you start pluggin\\' diners.\\nWaitresses, forget it, they ain\\'t takin\\' a\\nbullet for the register. Busboys, some\\nwetback gettin\\' paid a dollar fifty a hour\\ngonna really give a fuck you\\'re stealin\\'\\nfrom the owner. Customers are sittin\\'\\nthere with food in their mouths, they\\ndon\\'t know what\\'s goin\\' on. One minute\\nthey\\'re havin\\' a Denver omelette, next\\nminute somebody\\'s stickin\\' a gun in their\\nface.\\nThe Young Woman visibly takes in the idea. The Young Man continues\\nin a low voice.\\nYOUNG MAN\\nSee, I got the idea last liquor store we\\nstuck up. \\'Member all those customers kept\\ncomin\\' in?\\nYOUNG WOMAN\\nYeah.\\nYOUNG MAN\\nThey you got the idea to take everybody\\'s\\nwallet.\\nYOUNG WOMAN\\nUh-huh.\\nYOUNG MAN\\nThat was a good idea.\\nYOUNG WOMAN\\nThanks.\\nYOUNG MAN\\nWe made more from the wallets then we did\\nthe register.\\nYOUNG WOMAN\\nYes we did.\\nYOUNG MAN\\nA lot of people go to restaurants.\\nYOUNG WOMAN\\nA lot of wallets.\\nYOUNG MAN\\nPretty smart, huh?\\nThe Young Woman scans the restaurant with this new information.\\nShe sees all the PATRONS eating, lost in conversations. The tires\\nWAITRESS, taking orders. The BUSBOYS going through the motions,}\\ncollecting dishes. The MANAGER complaining to the COOK about\\nsomething. A smiles breaks out on the Young Woman\\'s face.\\nYOUNG WOMAN\\nPretty smart.\\n(into it)\\nI\\'m ready, let\\'s go, right here, right\\nnow.\\nYOUNG MAN\\nRemember, same as before, you\\'re crowd\\ncontrol, I handle the employees.\\nYOUNG WOMAN\\nGot it.\\nThey both take out their .32-caliber pistols and lay them on the\\ntable. He looks at her and she back at him.\\nYOUNG WOMAN\\nI love you, Pumpkin.\\nYOUNG MAN\\nI love you, Honey Bunny.\\nAnd with that, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny grab their weapons, stand\\nup and rob the restaurant. Pumpkin\\'s robbery persona is that of\\nthe in-control professional. Honey Bunny\\'s is that of the\\npsychopathic, hair-triggered, loose cannon.\\nPUMPKIN\\n(yelling to all)\\nEverybody be cool this is a robbery!\\nHONEY BUNNY\\nAny of you fuckin\\' pricks move and I\\'ll\\nexecute every one of you motherfuckers!\\nGot that?\\nCUT TO:\\nCREDIT SEQUENCE:\\n\"PULP FICTION\"\\nINT. \\'74 CHEVY (MOVING) – MORNING\\nAn old gas guzzling, dirty, white 1974 Chevy Nova BARRELS down a\\nhomeless-ridden street in Hollywood. In the front seat are two\\nyoung fellas – one white, one black – both wearing cheap black\\nsuits with thin black ties under long green dusters. Their names\\nare VINCENT VEGA (white) and JULES WINNFIELD (black). Jules is\\nbehind the wheel.\\nJULES\\n– Okay now, tell me about the hash bars?}\\nVINCENT\\nWhat so you want to know?\\nJULES\\nWell, hash is legal there, right?\\nVINCENT\\nYeah, it\\'s legal, but is ain\\'t a hundred\\npercent legal. I mean you can\\'t walk into\\na restaurant, roll a joint, and start\\npuffin\\' away. You\\'re only supposed to\\nsmoke in your home or certain designated\\nplaces.\\nJULES\\nThose are hash bars?\\nVINCENT\\nYeah, it breaks down like this: it\\'s legal\\nto buy it, it\\'s legal to own it and, if\\nyou\\'re the proprietor of a hash bar, it\\'s\\nlegal to sell it. It\\'s legal to carry it,\\nwhich doesn\\'t really matter \\'cause – get a\\nload of this – if the cops stop you, it\\'s\\nillegal for this to search you. Searching\\nyou is a right that the cops in Amsterdam\\ndon\\'t have.\\nJULES\\nThat did it, man – I\\'m fuckin\\' goin\\',\\nthat\\'s all there is to it.\\nVINCENT\\nYou\\'ll dig it the most.

And I don\\'t mean in a paper\\ncup either. They give you a glass of beer,\\nlike in a bar. In Paris, you can buy beer\\nat MacDonald\\'s. Also, you know what they\\ncall a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in\\nParis?\\nJULES\\nThey don\\'t call it a Quarter Pounder with\\nCheese?}\\nVINCENT\\nNo, they got the metric system there, they\\nwouldn\\'t know what the fuck a Quarter\\nPounder is.\\nJULES\\nWhat\\'d they call it?\\nVINCENT\\nRoyale with Cheese.\\nJULES\\n(repeating)\\nRoyale with Cheese. What\\'d they call a Big\\nMac?\\nVINCENT\\nBig Mac\\'s a Big Mac, but they call it Le\\nBig Mac.\\nJULES\\nLe Big Mac. What do they call a Whopper?\\nVINCENT\\nI dunno, I didn\\'t go into a Burger King.\\nBut you know what they put on french fries\\nin Holland instead of ketchup?\\nJULES\\nWhat?\\nVINCENT\\nMayonnaise.\\nJULES\\nGoddamn!\\nVINCENT\\nI seen \\'em do it.

She\\nusta be an actress.\\nVINCENT\\nShe ever do anything I woulda saw?\\nJULES\\nI think her biggest deal was she starred\\nin a pilot.\\nVINCENT\\nWhat\\'s a pilot?\\nJULES\\nWell, you know the shows on TV?\\nVINCENT\\nI don\\'t watch TV.}\\nJULES\\nYes, but you\\'re aware that there\\'s an\\ninvention called television, and on that\\ninvention they show shows?\\nVINCENT\\nYeah.\\nJULES\\nWell, the way they pick the shows on TV is\\nthey make one show, and that show\\'s called\\na pilot. And they show that one show to\\nthe people who pick the shows, and on the\\nstrength of that one show, they decide if\\nthey want to make more shows. Some get\\naccepted and become TV programs, and some\\ndon\\'t, and become nothing. She starred in\\none of the ones that became nothing.\\nThey enter the apartment building.\\nINT.

That ain\\'t\\nright, man. Motherfucker do that to me, he\\nbetter paralyze my ass, \\'cause I\\'d kill\\'a\\nmotherfucker.\\nVINCENT\\nI\\'m not sayin\\' he was right, but you\\'re\\nsayin\\' a foot massage don\\'t mean nothing,\\nand I\\'m sayin\\' it does.

JACKRABBIT SLIM\\'S – NIGHT\\nIn the past six years, 50\\'s diners have sprung up all over L.A.,\\ngiving Thai restaurants a run for their money. They\\'re all\\nbasically the same. Decor out of an \"Archie\" comic book, Golden\\nOldies constantly emanating from a bubbly Wurlitzer, saucy\\nwaitresses in bobby socks, menus with items like the Fats Domino\\nCheeseburger, or the Wolfman Jack Omelette, and over prices that\\npay for all this bullshit.\\nBut then there\\'s JACKRABBIT SLIM\\'S, the big mama of 50\\'s diners.\\nEither the best or the worst, depending on your point of view.}\\nVincent\\'s Malibu pulls up to the restaurant.

JACKRABBIT SLIM\\'S – NIGHT\\nCompared to the interior, the exterior was that of a quaint\\nEnglish pub. Posters from 50\\'s A.I.P. movies are all over the wall\\n(\"ROCK ALL NIGHT,\" \"HIGH SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL,\" \"ATTACK OF THE CRAB\\nMONSTER,\" and \"MACHINE GUN KELLY\"). The booths that the patrons\\nsit in are made out of the cut up bodies of 50s cars.\\nIn the middle of the restaurant in a dance floor. A big sign on\\nthe wall states, \"No shoes allowed.\"So wannabe beboppers (actually\\nMelrose-types), do the twist in their socks or barefeet.\\nThe picture windows don\\'t look out the street, but instead, B & W\\nmovies of 50\\'s street scenes play behind them. The WAITRESSES and\\nWAITERS are made up as replicas of 50\\'s icons: MARILYN MONROE,\\nZORRO, JAMES DEAN, DONNA REED, MARTIN and LEWIS, and THE PHILIP\\nMORRIS MIDGET, wait on tables wearing appropriate costumes.\\nVincent and Mia study the menu in a booth made out of a red \\'59\\nEdsel.

The YUPPIES are dancing,\\nthe DINERS are biting into big, juicy hamburgers, and the icons\\nare playing their parts. Marilyn is squealing, The Midget is\\npaging Philip Morris, Donna Reed is making her customers drink\\ntheir milk, and Dean and Jerry are acting a fool.\\nMIA\\nWhaddya think?\\nVINCENT\\nIt\\'s like a wax museum with a pulse rate.}\\nVincent takes out his pouch of tobacco and begins rolling himself\\na smoke.\\nAfter a second of watching him –\\nMIA\\nWhat are you doing?\\nVINCENT\\nRollin\\' a smoke.\\nMIA\\nHere?\\nVINCENT\\nIt\\'s just tobacco.\\nMIA\\nOh. Well in that case, will you roll me\\none, cowboy?\\nAs he finishes licking it –\\nVINCENT\\nYou can have his one, cowgirl.\\nHe hands her the rolled smoke. She takes it, putting it to her\\nlips. Out of nowhere appears a Zippo lighter in Vincent\\'s hand. He\\nlights it.\\nMIA\\nThanks.\\nVINCENT\\nThink nothing of it.\\nHe begins rolling one for himself.\\nAs this time, the SOUND of a subway car fills the diner, making\\neverything SHAKE and RATTLE. Marilyn Monroe runs to a square vent\\nin the floor. An imaginary subway train BLOWS the skirt of her\\nwhite dress around her ears as she lets out a squeal. The entire\\nrestaurant applauds.\\nBack to Mia and Vincent.\\nMIA\\nMarsellus said you just got back from\\nAmsterdam.\\nVINCENT\\nSure did. I heard you did a pilot.\\nMIA\\nThat was my fifteen minutes.\\nVINCENT\\nWhat was it?}\\nMIA\\nIt was show about a team of female secret\\nagents called \"Fox Force Five.\"\\nVINCENT\\nWhat?\\nMIA\\n\"Fox Force Five.\"Fox, as in we\\'re a bunch\\nof foxy chicks. Force, as in we\\'re a force\\nto be reckoned with. Five, as in there\\'s\\none... two ... three... four... five of\\nus. There was a blonde one, Sommerset\\nO\\'Neal from that show \"Baton Rouge,\" she\\nwas the leader. A Japanese one, a black\\none, a French one and a brunette one, me.\\nWe all had special skills. Sommerset had a\\nphotographic memory, the Japanese fox was\\na kung fu master, the black girl was a\\ndemolition expert, the French fox\\'\\nspecialty was sex...\\nVINCENT\\nWhat was your specialty?\\nMIA\\nKnives. The character I played, Raven\\nMcCoy, her background was she was raised\\nby circus performers. So she grew up doing\\na knife act. According to the show, she\\nwas the deadliest woman in the world with\\na knife. But because she grew up in a\\ncircus, she was also something of an\\nacrobat. She could do illusions, she was a\\ntrapeze artist – when you\\'re keeping the\\nworld safe from evil, you never know when\\nbeing a trapeze artist\\'s gonna come in\\nhandy. And she knew a zillion old jokes\\nher grandfather, an old vaudevillian,\\ntaught her. If we woulda got picked up,\\nthey woulda worked in a gimmick where\\nevery episode I woulda told and ol joke.\\nVINCENT\\nDo you remember any of the jokes?\\nMIA\\nWell I only got the chance to say one,\\n\\'cause we only did one show.\\nVINCENT\\nTell me.\\nMIA\\nNo. It\\'s really corny.\\nVINCENT\\nC\\'mon, don\\'t be that way.}\\nMIA\\nNo. You won\\'t like it and I\\'ll be\\nembarrassed.\\nVINCENT\\nYou told it in front of fifty million\\npeople and you can\\'t tell it to me? I\\npromise I won\\'t laugh.\\nMIA\\n(laughing)\\nThat\\'s what I\\'m afraid of.\\nVINCENT\\nThat\\'s not what I meant and you know it.\\nMIA\\nYou\\'re quite the silver tongue devil,\\naren\\'t you?\\nVINCENT\\nI meant I wouldn\\'t laugh at you.\\nMIA\\nThat\\'s not what you said Vince. Well now\\nI\\'m definitely not gonna tell ya, \\'cause\\nit\\'s been built up too much.\\nVINCENT\\nWhat a gyp.\\nBuddy comes back with the drinks. Mia wraps her lips around the\\nstraw of her shake.\\nMIA\\nYummy!\\nVINCENT\\nCan I have a sip of that? I\\'d like to know\\nwhat a five-dollar shake tastes like.\\nMIA\\nBe my guest.\\nShe slides the shake over to him.\\nMIA\\nYou can use my straw, I don\\'t have\\nkooties.\\nVincent smiles.\\nVINCENT\\nYeah, but maybe I do.\\nMIA\\nKooties I can handle.\\nHe takes a sip.}\\nVINCENT\\n Goddamn!

You\\ncould ask me what you\\'re gonna ask me, and\\nmy natural response could be to be\\noffended. Then, through no fault of my\\nown, I woulda broken my promise.\\nVINCENT\\nThen let\\'s just forget it.\\nMIA\\nThat is an impossibility.

But that doesn\\'t\\nmean it didn\\'t happen. I heard Marsellus\\nis very protective of you.\\nMIA\\nA husband being protective of his wife is\\none thing.

She touches its sleeve. It feels good.\\nHer hand hoes in its pocket and pulls out his tobacco pouch. Like\\na little girl playing cowboy, she spreads the tobacco on some\\nrolling paper. Imitating what he did earlier, licks the paper and\\nrolls it into a pretty good cigarette. Maybe a little too fat, but\\nnot bad for a first try. Mia thinks so anyway. Her hand reaches\\nback in the pocket and pulls out his Zippo lighter. She SLAPS the\\nlighter against her leg, trying to light it fancy-style like Vince\\ndid. What do you know, she did it!

She\\ntriumphantly brings the fat flame up to her fat smoke, lighting it\\nup, then LOUDLY SNAPS the Zippo closed.\\nThe Mia-made cigarette is brought up to her lips, and she takes a\\nlong, cool drag.

It was bought\\nduring the First World War in a little\\ngeneral store in Knoxville, Tennessee. It\\nwas bought by private Doughboy Ernie\\nCoolidge the day he set sail for Paris. It\\nwas your great-granddaddy\\'s war watch,\\nmade by the first company to ever make\\nwrist watches. You see, up until then,\\npeople just carried pocket watches. Your\\ngreat-granddaddy wore that watch every day\\nhe was in the war. Then when he had done\\nhis duty, he went home to your great-\\ngrandmother, took the watch off his wrist\\nand put it in an ol\\' coffee can. And in\\nthat can it stayed \\'til your grandfather\\nDane Coolidge was called upon by his\\ncountry to go overseas and fight the\\nGermans once again. This time they called\\nit World War Two. Your great-granddaddy\\ngave it to your granddad for good luck.\\nUnfortunately, Dane\\'s luck wasn\\'t as good\\nas his old man\\'s. Your granddad was a\\n(MORE)}\\nCAPT. KOONS (CONT\\'D)\\nMarine and he was killed with all the\\nother Marines at the battle of Wake\\nIsland. Your granddad was facing death and\\nhe knew it. None of those boys had any\\nillusions about ever leavin\\' that island\\nalive. So three days before the Japanese\\ntook the island, your 22-year old\\ngrandfather asked a gunner on an Air Force\\ntransport named Winocki, a man he had\\nnever met before in his life, to deliver\\nto his infant son, who he had never seen\\nin the flesh, his gold watch. Three days\\nlater, your grandfather was dead. But\\nWinocki kept his word. After the war was\\nover, he paid a visit to your grandmother,\\ndelivering to your infant father, his\\nDad\\'s gold watch. This watch. This watch\\nwas on your Daddy\\'s wrist when he was shot\\ndown over Hanoi. He was captured and put\\nin a Vietnamese prison camp. Now he knew\\nif the gooks ever saw the watch it\\'s be\\nconfiscated. The way your Daddy looked at\\nit, that watch was your birthright. And\\nhe\\'d be damned if and slopeheads were\\ngonna put their greasy yella hands on his\\nboy\\'s birthright. So he hid it in the one\\nplace he knew he could hide somethin\\'. His\\nass. Five long years, he wore this watch\\nup his ass. Then when he died of\\ndisentary, he gave me the watch. I hid\\nwith uncomfortable hunk of metal up my ass\\nfor two years. Then, after seven years, I\\nwas sent home to my family. And now,\\nlittle man, I give the watch to you.\\nCapt. Koons hands the watch to Butch.

But on a woman,\\na pot belly is very sexy. The rest of you\\nis normal. Normal face, normal legs,\\nnormal hips, normal ass, but with a big,\\nperfectly round pot belly. If I had one,\\nI\\'d wear a tee-shirt two sizes too small\\nto accentuate it.\\nBUTCH\\nYou think guys would find that attractive?}\\nFABIENNE\\nI don\\'t give a damn what men find\\nattractive.

We see\\nFabienne in a white terry cloth robe that seems to swallow her up.\\nShe\\'s drying her head with a towel. Butch is inside the shower\\nwashing up. We see the outline of his naked body through the smoky\\nglass of the shower door. Steam fills the bathroom. Butch turns\\nthe shower off and opens the door, popping his head out.\\nBUTCH\\nI think I cracked a rib.\\nFABIENNE\\nGiving me oral pleasure?\\nBUTCH\\nNo retard, from the fight.\\nFABIENNE\\nDon\\'t call me retard.\\nBUTCH\\n(in a Mongoloid voice)\\nMy name is Fabby!

Wherever you want. We\\'re\\ngonna get a lot of money from this. But it\\nain\\'t gonna be so much, we can live like\\nhogs in the fat house forever. I was\\nthinking we could go somewhere in the\\nSouth Pacific. The kinda money we\\'ll\\nhave\\'ll carry us a long way down there.\\nFABIENNE\\nSo if we wanted, we could live in Bora\\nBora?\\nBUTCH\\nYou betcha. And if after awhile you don\\'t\\ndig Bora Bora, then we can move over to\\nTahiti or Mexico.\\nFABIENNE\\nBut I do not speak Spanish.}\\nBUTCH\\nYou don\\'t speak Bora Boran either.\\nBesides, Mexican is easy: Donde esta el\\nzapataria?\\nFABIENNE\\nWhat does that mean?\\nBUTCH\\nWhere\\'s the shoe store?\\nFABIENNE\\nDonde esta el zapataria?\\nBUTCH\\nExcellent pronunciation. You\\'ll be my\\nlittle mama ceta in no time.\\nButch exits the bathroom.

You startled me. Did you have a bad\\ndream?\\nButch squints down the front of the bed at her, trying to focus.\\nButch, still trying to chase the cobwebs away, sees on TV Hell\\'s\\nAngels tear-assin\\' through a Vietnamese prison camp.\\nBUTCH\\nWhat are you watching?\\nFABIENNE\\nA motorcycle movie, I\\'m not sure the name.\\nBUTCH\\nAre you watchin\\' it?\\nFabienne enters the room.\\nFABIENNE\\nIn a way. Why? Would you like for me to\\nswitch it off?\\nBUTCH\\nWould you please?\\nShe reaches over and turns off the TV.\\nBUTCH\\nIt\\'s a little too early in the morning for\\nexplosions and war.\\nFABIENNE\\nWhat was it about?\\nBUTCH\\nHow should I know, you were the one\\nwatchin\\' it.\\nFabienne laughs.\\nFABIENNE\\nNo, imbecile, what was your dream about?}\\nBUTCH\\nOh, I... don\\'t remember.

So where is it?\\nFabienne is crying and scared.\\nButch lowers his voice, which only serves to make him more\\nmenacing.\\nBUTCH\\nFabienne, that was my father\\'s fuckin\\'\\nwatch. You know what my father went\\nthrough to git me that watch?... I don\\'t\\nwanna get into it right now... but he went\\nthrough a lot.

HONDA (MOVING) – DAY\\nButch is beating the steering wheel and the dash with his fists as\\nhe drives down the street.\\nBUTCH\\nOf all the fuckin\\' things she coulda\\nforgot, she forgets my father\\'s watch.

CITY STREET – DAY\\nThe little Honda races toward its destination as fast as is little\\nengine will take it.\\nCUT TO:\\nA parking meter red flag rises up, then out, leaving the arrow\\npointing at one hour.\\nEXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET CORNER – DAY\\nButch isn\\'t completely reckless. He has parked his car a couple of\\nblocks from his apartment to check things out before he goes\\nboppin\\' through the front door.\\nEXT. ALLEY – DAY\\nButch walks down the alley until he gets to another street, then\\nhe discreetly glances out.\\nEXT. STREET – BUTCH\\'S APARTMENT – DAY\\nEverything seems normal. More or less the right number of cars in\\nthe street. None of the parked cars appear out of place. None of\\nthem have a couple of goons sitting inside. Basically, it looks\\nlike normal morning activity in front of Butch\\'s home.\\nButch peers around a wall, taking in the vital information.\\nButch walks out of the alley and is ready for anything. He crosses\\nthe street and enters his apartment courtyard.\\nAcross the street from Butch\\'s building, on the corner, is a\\ncombination donut shop and Japanese restaurant. A big sign sticks\\nup in the air, with the name \"Teriyaki Donut\" and a graphic of a\\ndonut sticking out of a bowl of rice.\\nEXT. BUTCH\\'S APARTMENT COURTYARD – DAY\\nButch is in the courtyard of his North Hollywood apartment\\nbuilding. Once again, everything appears normal – the laundry\\nroom, the pool, his apartment door – nothing appears disturbed.\\nButch climbs the stairs leading to his apartment, number 12. He\\nsteps outside the door and listens inside. Nothing.\\nButch slowly inserts the key into the door, quietly opening it.\\nINT. BUTCH\\'S APARTMENT – DAY\\nHis apartment hasn\\'t been touched.}\\nHe cautiously steps inside, shuts the door and takes a quick look\\naround. Obviously, no one is there.\\nButch walks into his modest kitchen, and opens the refrigerator.\\nHe takes out a carton of milk and drinks from\\nit.\\nWith carton in hard, Butch surveys the apartment. Then he goes to\\nthe bedroom.\\nHis bedroom is like the rest of the apartment – neat, clean and\\nanonymous. The only things personal in his room are a few boxing\\ntrophies, an Olympic silver medal, a framed issue of \"Ring\\nMagazine\" with Butch on the cover, and a poster of Jerry Quarry\\nand one of George Chuvalo.\\nSure enough, there\\'s the watch just like he said it was: On the\\nbedside table, hanging on his little kangaroo statue.\\nHe walks through the apartment and back into the kitchen. He opens\\na cupboard and takes out a box of Pop Tarts. Putting down the\\nmilk, he opens the box, takes out two Pop Tarts and puts them in\\nthe toaster.\\nButch glances to his right, his eyes fall on something.\\nWhat he sees is a small compact Czech M61 submachine gun with a\\nhuge silencer on it, lying on his kitchen counter.\\nBUTCH\\n(softly)\\nHoly shit.\\nHe picks up the intimidating peace of weaponary and examines it.\\nThen... a toilet FLUSHES.\\nButch looks up to the bathroom door, which is parallel to the\\nkitchen. There is someone behind it.\\nLike a rabbit caught in a radish patch, Butch freezes, not knowing\\nwhat to do.\\nThe bathroom door opens and Vincent Vega steps out of  the\\nbathroom, tightening his belt. In his hand is the book \"MODESTY\\nBLAISE\" by Peter O\\'Donnell.\\nVincent and Butch lock eyes.\\nVincent freezes.\\nButch doesn\\'t move, except to point the M61 in Vincent\\'s\\ndirection.\\nNeither man opens his mouth.\\nThen... the toaster LOUDLY kicks up the Pop Tarts.\\nThat\\'s all the situation needed.}\\nButch\\'s finger HITS the trigger.\\nMUFFLED FIRE SHOOTS out of the end of the gun.\\nVincent is seemingly WRACKED with twenty bullets SIMULTANEOUSLY –\\nLIFTING him off his feet, PROPELLING him through the air and\\nCRASHING through the glass shower door at the end of the bathroom.\\nBy the time Butch removes his finger from the trigger, Vincent is\\nannihilated.\\nButch stands frozen, amazed at what just happened. His look goes\\nfrom the grease spot in the bathroom that was once Vincent, down\\nto the powerful piece of artillery in his grip.\\nWith the respect it deserves, Butch carefully places the M61 back\\non the kitchen counter.\\nThen he exits the apartment, quickly.\\nEXT. APARTMENT COURTYARD – DAY\\nButch, not running, but walking very rapidly, crosses the\\ncourtyard...\\n... comes out of the apartment building, crosses the street...\\n... goes through the alley...\\n... and into his car in one STEADICAM SHOT.\\nEXT. HONDA – DAY\\nButch CRANKS the car into gear and drives away. The big wide smile\\nof a survivor breaks across his face.\\nEXT. APARTMENT BUILDING STREET – DAY\\nThe Honda turns down the alley and slowly cruises by his apartment\\nbuilding.\\nINT. HONDA – DAY\\nButch looks out the window at his former home.\\nBUTCH\\nThat\\'s how you\\'re gonna beat \\'em, Butch.\\nThey keep underestimatin\\' ya.\\nThis makes the boxer laugh out loud. As he laughs, he flips a tape\\nin the cassette player. When the MUSIC starts, he SINGS along with\\nit.\\nHe drives by the apartment, but is stopped at the light on the\\ncorner across from Teriyaki Donut.}\\nButch is still chuckling, singing along with the song, as we see:\\nTHROUGH THE WINDSHIELD\\nThe big man himself, Marsellus Wallace, exit Teriyaki Donut,\\ncarrying a box of a dozen donuts and two large styrofoam cups of\\ncoffee. He steps off the curb, crossing the street in front of\\nButch\\'s car. This is the first time we see Marsellus clearly.\\nLaughing boy stops when he sees the big man directly in front of\\nhim.\\nWhen Marsellus is in front of Butch\\'s car, he casually glances to\\nhis left, sees Butch, continues walking... then STOPS!\\nDOUBLE-TAKE: \"Am I really seeing what I\\'m seeing?\"\\nButch doesn\\'t wait for the big man to answer his own question. He\\nSTOMPS on the gas pedal.\\nThe little Honda SLAMS into Marsellus, sending him, the donuts and\\nthe coffee HITTING the pavement at thirty miles an hour.\\nButch CUTS into cross traffic and is BROAD-SIDED by a gold Camaro\\nZ-28, BREAKING all the windows in the Honda and sending it up on\\nthe sidewalk.\\nButch sits dazed and confused in the crumpled mess of what at one\\ntime was Fabienne\\'s Honda. Blood flows from his nostrils. The\\nstill-functional tape player continues to play. A PEDESTRIAN pokes\\nhis head inside.\\nPEDESTRIAN\\nJesus, are you okay?\\nButch look at him, spaced-out.\\nBUTCH\\nI guess.\\nMarsellus Wallace lies sprawled out in the street. GAWKERS gather\\naround the body.\\nGAWKER #1\\n(to the others)\\nHe\\'s dead! He\\'s dead!\\nThis jerk\\'s yelling makes Marsellus come to.\\nTWO PEDESTRIANS help the shaken Butch out of the wreckage.\\nThe woozy Marsellus gets to his feet.\\nGAWKER #2\\nIf you need a witness in court, I\\'ll be\\nglad to help.

She falls to the ground,\\nscreaming.\\nLOOKY-LOO WOMAN\\nOh my God, I\\'ve been shot!\\nThat\\'s all Butch needs to see. He\\'s outta here.\\nMarsellus RUNS after him.\\nThe CROWD looks agape.\\nButch is in a mad, limping RUN.\\nThe big man\\'s hot on his ass with a cockeyed wobbly run.\\nButch cuts across traffic and dashes into a business with a sign\\nthat reads \"MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP\".\\nINT. MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP – DAY\\nMAYNARD, a hillbilly-lookin\\' boy, stands behind the counter of his\\npawnshop when, all of a sudden, chaos in the form of Butch RACES\\ninto his world.\\nMAYNARD\\nCan I help you wit\\' somethin\\'?\\nBUTCH\\nShut up!\\nButch quickly takes measure of the situation, than stands next to\\nthe door.}\\nMAYNARD\\nNow you just wait one goddamn minute –\\nBefore Maynard can finish his threat, Marsellus CHARGES in. He\\ndoesn\\'t get past the doorway  because Butch LANDS his fist in\\nMarsellus\\' face.\\nThe gangster\\'s feet go out from under him and the big man FALLS\\nFLAT on his back.\\nOutside, two police cars with their SIRENS BLARING race by.\\nButch POUNCES on the fallen body, PUNCHING him twice more in the\\nface.\\nButch takes the gun out of Marsellus\\' hand, than grabs ahold of\\nhis middle finger.\\nBUTCH\\nSo you like chasing people, huh?\\nHe BREAKS the finger. Marsellus lets out a pain sound.Butch then\\nplaces the barrel of the .45 between his eyes, PULLS back the\\nhammer and places his open hand behind the gun to shield the\\nsplatter.\\nBUTCH\\nWell guess what, big man, you caught me –\\nMAYNARD (O.S.)\\n– hold it right there, godammit!\\nButch and Marsellus look up at Maynard, who\\'s brandishing a pump-\\naction shotgun, aimed at the two men.\\nBUTCH\\nLook mister, this ain\\'t any of your\\nbusiness –\\nMAYNARD\\n– I\\'m makin\\' it my business! Now toss that\\ngun!\\nButch does.\\nMAYNARD\\nNow you on top, stand up and come to the\\ncounter.\\nButch slowly gets up and moves to the counter. As soon as he gets\\nthere, Maynard HAULS OFF, HITTING him hard in the face with the\\nbutt of the shotgun, knocking Butch down and out.\\nAfter Butch goes down, Maynard calmly lays the shotgun on the\\ncounter and moves to the telephone.\\nMarsellus Wallace, from his position on the floor, groggily\\nwatches the pawnshop owner dial a number. Maynard waits on the\\nline while the other end rings. Then it picks up.}\\nMAYNARD\\nZed? It\\'s Maynard. The spider just caught\\na coupl\\'a flies.\\nMarsellus passes out.\\nFADE TO BLACK\\nFADE UP:\\nINT. PAWNSHOP BACK ROOM – DAY\\nTWO SHOT – BUTCH AND MARSELLUS\\nThey are tied up in two separate chairs. In their mouths are two\\nS&M-style ball gags (a belt goes around their heads and a little\\nred ball sticks in their mouths). Both men are unconscious.\\nMaynard steps in with a fire extinguisher and SPRAYS both guys\\nuntil they\\'re wide awake and wet as otters. The two prisoners look\\nup at their captors.\\nMaynard stands in front of them, fire extinguisher in one hand,\\nshotgun in the other, and Marsellus\\' .45 sticking in his belt.\\nMAYNARD\\nNobody kills anybody in my place of\\nbusiness except me or Zed.\\nA BUZZER buzzes.\\nMAYNARD\\nThat\\'s Zed.\\nWithout saying another word, Maynard climbs up the stairs that\\nlead to red curtains and goes through them.\\nWE HEAR, on the other side of the curtains, Maynard let Zed inside\\nthe store.\\nButch and Marsellus look around the room. The basement of the\\npawnshop has been converted into a dungeon. After taking in their\\npredicament, Butxh and Marsellus look at each other, all traces of\\nhostility gone, replaced by a terror they both share at what\\nthey\\'ve gotten themselves into.\\nMaynard and ZED come through the curtains. Zed is an even more\\nintense version of Maynard, if such a thing is possible. The two\\nhillbillys are obviously brothers. Where Maynard is a vicious\\npitbull, Zed is a deadly cobra. Zed walks in and stands in front\\nof the two captives. He inspects them for a long time, then says:\\nZED\\n(to Maynard)\\nYou said you waited for me?\\nMAYNARD\\nI did.}\\nZED\\nThen how come they\\'re all beat up?\\nMAYNARD\\nThey did that to each other. They was\\nfightin\\' when they came in. This one was\\ngonna shoot that one.\\nZED\\n(to Butch)\\nYou were gonna shoot him?\\nButch makes no reply.\\nZED\\nHey, is Grace gonna be okay in front of\\nthis place?\\nMAYNARD\\nYeah, it ain\\'t Tuesday is it?\\nZED\\nNo, it\\'s Thursday.\\nMAYNARD\\nThen she\\'ll be fine.\\nZED\\nBring out The Gimp.\\nMAYNARD\\nI think The Gimp\\'s sleepin\\'.\\nZED\\nWell, I guess you\\'ll just wake \\'em up\\nthen, won\\'t you?\\nMaynard opens a trap door in the floor.\\nMAYNARD\\n(yelling in the hole)\\nWake up!\\nMaynard reaches into the hole and comes back holding onto a leash.\\nHe gives it a rough yank and, from below the floor, rises THE\\nGIMP.\\nThe Gimp is a man they keep dressed from head to toe in black\\nleather bondage gear. There are zippers, buckles and studs here\\nand there on the body. On his head is a black leather mask with\\ntwo eye holes and a zipper (closed) for a mouth. They keep him in\\na hole in the floor big enough for a large dog.\\nZed takes the chair, sits it in front of the two prisoners, then\\nlowers into it. Maynard hands The Gimp\\'s leash to Zed, then backs\\naway.\\nMAYNARD\\n(to The Gimp)\\nDown!}\\nThe Gimp gets on its knees.\\nMaynard hangs back while Zed appraises the two men.\\nMAYNARD\\nWho\\'s first?\\nZED\\nI ain\\'t fer sure yet.\\nThen with his little finger, Zed does a silent \"Eenie, meany,\\nminey, moe... \" just his mouth mouthing the words and his finger\\ngoing back and forth between the two.\\nButch are Marsellus are terrified.\\nMaynard looks back and forth at the victims.\\nThe Gimps\\'s eyes go from one to the other inside the mask.\\nZed continues his silent sing-song with his finger moving left to\\nright, then it stops.\\nTWO SHOT – BUTCH AND MARSELLUS\\nAfter a beat, THE CAMERA MOVES to the right, zeroing in on\\nMarsellus.\\nZed stands up.\\nZED\\nWanna do it here?\\nMAYNARD\\nNaw, drag big boy to Russell\\'s old room.\\nZed grabs Marsellus\\' chair and DRAGS him into Russell\\'s old room.\\nRussell, no doubt, was some other poor bastard that has the\\nmisfortune of stumbling into the Mason-Dixie pawnshop. Whatever\\nhappened to Russell is known only to Maynard and Zed because his\\nold room, a back room in the back of the back room, is empty.\\nAs Marsellus is dragged away, he locks eyes with Butch before he\\ndisappears behind the door of Russell\\'s old room.\\nMAYNARD\\n(to The Gimp)\\nUp!\\nThe Gimp rises. Maynard ties The Gimp\\'s leash to a hook on the\\nceiling.\\nMAYNARD\\nKeep an eye on this one.\\nThe Gimp bows its head: \"yes.\"Maynard disappears into Russell\\'s\\nold room. There must be a stereo in there because suddenly The\\nJudds, singing in harmony, fills the air.}\\nButch looks at The Gimp. The Gimp giggles from underneath the mask\\nas if this were the funniest moment in the history of comedy.\\nFrom behind the door we hear country MUSIC, struggling, and:\\nMAYNARD (O.S.)\\nWhoa, this boy\\'s got a bit of fight in\\n\\'em!\\nWe the HEAR Maynard and Zed beat on Marsellus.\\nZED (O.S.)\\nYou wanna fight? You wanna fight? Good, I\\nlike to fight!\\nButch pauses, listens to the voices. Then, in a panic, hurriedly\\nstruggles to get free.\\nThe Gimp is laughing wildly.\\nThe ropes are on too tight and Butch can\\'t break free.\\nThe Gimp slaps his knee laughing\\nIn the back room, we hear:\\nMAYNARD (O.S.)\\nThat\\'s it... that\\'s it boy, you\\'re goin\\'\\nfine. Oooooooh, just like that... that\\'s\\ngood.\\n(grunting faster)\\nStay still... stay still goddamn ya! Zed\\ngoddammit, git over here and hold \\'em!\\nButch stops struggling and lifts up on his arms. Then, quite\\neasily, the padded chair back slides up and off as if it were\\nnever connected by a bolt.\\nThe Gimp sees this and its eyes widen.\\nTHE GIMP\\nHuhng?\\nThe Gimp FLAILS WILDLY, trying to get the leash off the hook. He\\ntries to yell, but all that comes out are excited gurgles and\\ngrunts.\\nButch is out of his chair, quickly dispensing three BOXER\\'S\\nPUNCHES to its face. The punches knock The Gimp out, making him\\nfall to his knees, this HANGING HIMSELF by the leash attached to\\nthe hook,\\nButch removes the ball gag, then silently makes his way through\\nthe red curtains.}\\nINT. PAWNSHOP – DAY\\nButch sneaks to the door.\\nOn the counter is a big set of keys with a large Z connected to\\nthe ring. Grabbing them, he\\'s about to go out when he stops and\\nlistens to the hillbilly psychopaths having their way with\\nMarsellus.\\nButch decides for the life of him, he can\\'t leave anybody in a\\nsituation like that. Se he begins rooting around the pawnshop for\\na weapon to bash those hillbillies\\' heads in with.\\nHe picks up a big destructive-looking hammer, then discards it:\\nNot destructive enough. He picks up a chainsaw, thinks about it\\nfor a moment, then puts it back. Next, a large Louisville slugger\\nhe tries on for size. But then he spots what he\\'s been looking\\nfor:\\nA Samurai sword.\\nIt hands in its hand-carved wood sheath from a nail on the wall,\\nnext to a neon \"DAD\\'S OLD-FASHIONED ROOT BEER\" sign. Butch takes\\nthe sword off the wall, removing it from ist sheath. It\\'s a\\nmagnificent piece of steel. It seems to glisten in the low-wattage\\nlight of the pawnshop. Butch touches his thumb to the blade to see\\nif the sword is just for show. Not on your life. It\\'s as sharp as\\nit gets. This weapon seems made to order for the Brothers Grimm\\ndownstairs. Holding the sword pointed downward, Takakura Ken-\\nstyle, he disappears through the red curtains to take care of\\nbusiness.\\nINT. PAWNSHOP BACK ROOM – DAY\\nButch quietly sneaks down the stairs leading to the dungeon.\\nSodomy and the Judds can still be heard going string behind the\\nclosed door that leads to Russell\\'s old room.\\nINT. RUSSELL\\'S OLD ROOM – DAY\\nButch\\'s hand comes into frame, pushing the door open. It swings\\nopen silently, revealing the rapists, who have switched positions.\\nZed is now bent over Marsellus, who is bent over a wooden horse.\\nMaynard watches. Both have their backs to Butch.\\nMaynard faces the CAMERA, grinning, while Butch comes up behind\\nhim with the sword.\\nMiserable, violated, and looking like a rag doll, Marsellus, red\\nball gag still in mouth, opens his watery eyes to see Butch coming\\nup behind Maynard. His eyes widen.\\nBUTCH\\nHey hillbilly.\\nMaynard turns and sees Butch holding the sword.}\\nButch SCREAMS... with one mighty SWING, SLASHES Maynard across the\\nfront, moving past him, eyes and blade now locked on Zed.\\nMaynard stands trembling, his front sliced open, in shock.\\nButch, while never taking his eyes off Zed, THRUSTS the sword\\nbehind him, SKEWERING Maynard, then EXTRACTS it, pointing the\\nblade toward Zed. Maynard COLLAPSES.\\nZed disengages from Marsellus in a hurry and his eyes go from the\\ntip of Butch\\'s sword to Marsellus\\' .45 Automatic, which lies\\nwithin reach.\\nButch\\'s eyes follow Zed\\'s.\\nBUTCH\\nYou want that gun, Zed? Pick it up.\\nZed\\'s hand inches toward the weapon.\\nButch GRIPS the sword tighter.\\nZed studies Butch.\\nButch looks hard at Zed.\\nThen a VOICE says:\\nMARSELLUS (O.S.)\\nStep aside, Butch.\\nButch steps aside, REVEALING Marsellus standing behind him,\\nholding Maynard\\'s pump-action shotgun.\\nKABOOM!!!!\\nZed is BLASTED in the groin. Down he goes, SCREAMING in AGONY.\\nMarsellus, looking down at his whimpering rapist, EJECTS the used\\nshotgun shell.\\nButch lowers the sword and hangs back. Not a word, until:\\nBUTCH\\nYou okay?\\nMARSELLUS\\nNaw man. I\\'m pretty fuckin\\' far from okay!\\nLong pause.\\nBUTCH\\nWhat now?}\\nMARSELLUS\\nWhat now? Well let me tell you what now.\\nI\\'m gonna call a couple pipe-hittin\\'\\nniggers, who\\'ll go to work on homes here\\nwith a pair of pliers and a blow torch.\\n(to Zed)\\nHear me talkin\\' hillbilly boy?!

Gotta bit\\nof a situation.\\nEXT. MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP – DAY\\nButch, still shaking in his boots, exits the pawnshop. He looks\\nahead and sees, parked in front of the establishment, Zed\\'s Big\\nChrome Chopper with a teardrop gas tank that has the name \"GRACE\"\\non it. He climbs aboard, takes out the keys with the big Z on them\\nand starts up the huge hog. It RUMBLES to life, making sounds like\\na rocket fighting for orbit.

Vincent takes his place at the\\nsink.\\nVINCENT\\nJust tell \\'im not to be abusive. He kinda\\nfreaked out back there when he saw Marvin.\\nJULES\\nPut yourself in his position. It\\'s eight\\no\\'clock in the morning. He just woke up,\\nhe wasn\\'t prepared for this shit. Don\\'t\\nforget who\\'s doin\\' who a favor.\\nVincent finishes, then dries his hands on a white towel.\\nVINCENT\\nIf the price of that favor is I gotta take\\nshit, he can stick his favor straight up\\nhis ass.\\nWhen Vincent is finished drying his hands, the towel is stained\\nwith red.\\nJULES\\nWhat the fuck did you just do to his\\ntowel?\\nVINCENT\\nI was just dryin\\' my hands.\\nJULES\\nYou\\'re supposed to wash \\'em first.\\nVINCENT\\nYou watched me wash \\'em.\\nJULES\\nI watched you get \\'em wet.}\\nVINCENT\\nI washed \\'em. Blood\\'s real hard to get\\noff. Maybe if he had some Lava, I coulda\\ndone a better job.\\nJULES\\nI used the same soap you did and when I\\ndried my hands, the towel didn\\'t look like\\na fuckin\\' Maxie pad. Look, fuck it,\\nalright. Who cares? But it\\'s shit like\\nthis that\\'s gonna bring this situation to\\na boil. If he were to come in here and see\\nthat towel like that... I\\'m tellin\\' you\\nVincent, you best be cool. \\'Cause if I\\ngotta get in to it with Jimmie on account\\nof you... Look, I ain\\'t threatenin\\' you, I\\nrespect you an\\' all, just don\\'t put me in\\nthat position.\\nJULES\\nJules, you ask me nice like that, no\\nproblem. He\\'s your friend, you handle him.\\nINT. JIMMIE\\'S KITCHEN – MORNING\\nThree men are standing in Jimmie\\'s kitchen, each with a mug of\\ncoffee. Jules, Vincent and JIMMIE DIMMICK, a young man in his late\\n20s dressed in a bathrobe.\\nJULES\\nGoddamn Jimmie, this is some serious\\ngourmet shit. Me an\\' Vincent woulda been\\nsatisfied with freeze-dried Tasters\\nChoice. You spring this gourmet fuckin\\'\\nshit on us. What flavor is this?\\nJIMMIE\\nKnock it off, Julie.\\nJULES\\nWhat?\\nJIMMIE\\nI\\'m not a cobb or corn, so you can stop\\nbutterin\\' me up. I don\\'t need you to tell\\nme how good my coffee is. I\\'m the one who\\nbuys it, I know how fuckin\\' good it is.\\nWhen Bonnie goes shoppin;, she buys shit.\\nI buy the gourmet expensive stuff \\'cause\\nwhen I drink it, I wanna taste it. But\\nwhat\\'s on my mind at this moment isn\\'t the\\ncoffee in my kitchen, it\\'s the dead nigger\\nin my garage.\\nJULES\\nJimmie –}\\nJIMMIE\\n– I\\'m talkin\\'. Now let me ask you a\\nquestion, Jules. When you drove in here,\\ndid you notice a sign out front that said,\\n\"Dead nigger storage?\"\\nJules starts to \"Jimmie\" him –\\nJIMMIE\\n– answer to question. Did you see a sign\\nout in front of my house that said, \"Dead\\nnigger storage?\"\\nJULES\\n(playing along)\\nNaw man, I didn\\'t.\\nJIMMIE\\nYou know why you didn\\'t see that sign?\\nJULES\\nWhy?\\nJIMMIE\\n\\'Cause storin\\' dead niggers ain\\'t my\\nfuckin\\' business!\\nJules starts to \"Jimmie\" him.\\nJIMMIE\\n– I ain\\'t through! Now don\\'t you\\nunderstand that if Bonnie comes home and\\nfinds a dead body in her house, I\\'m gonna\\nget divorced. No marriage counselor, no\\ntrial separation – fuckin\\' divorced. And I\\ndon\\'t wanna get fuckin\\' divorced. The last\\ntime me an\\' Bonnie talked about this shit\\nwas gonna be the last time me an\\' Bonnie\\ntalked about this shit. Now I wanna help\\nya out Julie, I really do. But I ain\\'t\\ngonna lose my wife doin\\' it.\\nJULES\\nJimmie –\\nJIMMIE\\n– don\\'t fuckin\\' Jimmie me, man, I can\\'t be\\nJimmied. There\\'s nothin\\' you can say\\nthat\\'s gonna make me forget I love my\\nwife. Now she\\'s workin\\' the graveyard\\nshift at the hospital. She\\'ll be comin\\'\\nhome in less than an hour and a half. Make\\nyour phone calls, talk to your people,\\nthan get the fuck out of my house.\\nJULES\\nThat\\'s all we want. We don\\'t wanna fuck up\\nyour shit,We just need to call our people\\nto bring us in.}\\nJIMMIE\\nThen I suggest you get to it. Phone\\'s in\\nmy bedroom.\\nINT. MARSELLUS WALLACE\\'S DINING ROOM – MORNING\\nMarsellus Wallace sits at his dining table in a big comfy robe,\\neating his large breakfast, while talking on the phone.\\n MARSELLUS\\n... well, say she comes home. Whaddya\\nthink she\\'ll do?\\n(pause)\\nNo fuckin\\' shit she\\'ll freak. That ain\\'t\\nno kinda answer. You know \\'er, I don\\'t.\\nHow bad, a lot or a little?\\nINT. JIMMIE\\'S BEDROOM – MORNING\\nJules paces around in Jimmie\\'s bedroom on the phone.\\nJULES\\nYou got to appreciate what an explosive\\nelement this Bonnie situation is. If she\\ncomes home from a hard day\\'s work and\\nfinds a bunch of gangsters doin\\' a bunch\\nof gangsta\\' shit in her kitchen, ain\\'t no\\ntellin\\' what she\\'s apt to do.\\nMARSELLUS\\nI\\'ve grasped that, Jules. All I\\'m doin\\' is\\ncontemplating the \"ifs.\"\\nJULES\\nI don\\'t wanna hear about no motherfuckin\\'\\n\"ifs.\"What I wanna hear from your ass is:\\n\"you ain\\'t got no problems, Jules. I\\'m on\\nthe motherfucker. Go back in there, chill\\nthem niggers out and wait for the cavalry,\\nwhich should be comin\\' directly.\"\\nMARSELLUS\\nYou ain\\'t got no problems, Jules.

HOTEL SUITE – MORNING\\nThe CAMERA looks through the bedroom doorway of a hotel suite into\\nthe main area. We SEE a crap game being played on a fancy crap\\ntable by GAMBLERS in tuxedos and LUCKY LADIES in fancy evening\\ngowns. The CAMERA PANS to the right revealing: Sitting on a bed,\\nphone in hand with his back to us, the tuxedo-clad WINSTON WOLF\\naka \"THE WOLF\". We also see The Wolf has a small notepad that he\\njots details\\nin.\\nTHE WOLF\\n(into phone)\\nIs she the hysterical type?\\n(pause)\\nWhen she due?\\n(jotting down)\\nGive me the principals\\' names again?\\n(jots down)\\nJules...\\nWe SEE his book. The page has written on it:\\n\"1265 Riverside Drive\\nToluca Lake\\n1 body (no head)\\nBloody shot-up car\\nJules (black)\"\\nTHE WOLF\\n... Vincent... Jimmie... Bonnie...\\nHe writes:\\n\"Vincent (Dean Martin)\\nJimmie (house)\\nBonnie (9:30)\"\\nTHE WOLF\\nExpect a call around 10:30. It\\'s about\\nthirty minutes away. I\\'ll be there in ten.\\nHe hangs up. We never see his face.\\nCUT TO:\\nTITLE CARD OVER BLACK:\\n\"NINE MINUTES AND THIRTY-SEVEN SECONDS LATER\"\\nCUT TO:\\nEXT. JIMMIE\\'S STREET – MORNING\\nA silver Porsche WHIPS the corner leading to Jimmie\\'s home, in\\nHYPER DRIVE. Easily doing 135 mph, the Porsche stops on a dime in\\nfront of Jimmie\\'s house.}\\nA ringed finger touches the doorbell: DING DONG.\\nINT. JIMMIE\\'S HOUSE – MORNING\\nJimmie opens the door. We see, standing in the doorway, the\\ntuxedo-clad man. He looks down to his notebook, then up at Jimmie.\\nTHE WOLF\\nYou\\'re Jimmie, right? This is your house?\\nJIMMIE\\nYeah.\\nTHE WOLF\\n(stick his hand out)\\nI\\'m Winston Wolf, I solve problems.\\nJIMMIE\\nGood, \\'cause we got one.\\nTHE WOLF\\nSo I heard. May I come in?\\nJIMMIE\\nPlease do.\\nIn the dining room, Jules and Vincent stand up.\\nTHE WOLF\\nYou must be Jules, which would make you\\nVincent. Let\\'s get down to brass tacks,\\ngentlemen. If I was informed correctly,\\nthe clock is ticking, is that right,\\nJimmie?\\nJIMMIE\\n100%.\\nTHE WOLF\\nYour wife, Bonnie...\\n(refers to his pad)\\n... comes home at 9:30 in the AM, is that\\ncorrect?\\nJIMMIE\\nUh-huh.\\nTHE WOLF\\nI was led to believe if she comes home and\\nfinds us here, she wouldn\\'t appreciate it\\nnone too much.\\nJIMMIE\\nShe won\\'t at that.}\\nTHE WOLF\\nThat give use forty minutes to get the\\nfuck outta Dodge, which, if you do what I\\nsay when I say it, should by plenty. Now\\nyou got a corpse in a car, minus a head,\\nin a garage. Take me to it.\\nINT. JIMMIE\\'S GARAGE – MORNING\\nThe three men hand back as The Wolf examines the car. He studies\\nthe car in silence, opening the door, looking inside, circling it.\\nTHE WOLF\\nJimmie?\\nJIMMIE\\nYes.\\nTHE WOLF\\nDo me a favor, will ya? Thought I smelled\\nsome coffee in there. Would you make me a\\ncup?\\nJIMMIE\\nSure, how do you take it?\\nTHE WOLF\\nLotsa cream, lotsa sugar.\\nJimmie exists. The Wolf continues his examination.\\nTHE WOLF\\nAbout the car, is there anything I need to\\nknow? Does it stall, does it make a lot of\\nnoise, does it smoke, is there gas in it,\\nanything?\\nJULES\\nAside from how it looks, the car\\'s cool.\\nTHE WOLF\\nPositive? Don\\'t get me out on the road and\\nI find out the brake lights don\\'t work.\\nJULES\\nHey man, as far as I know, the\\nmotherfucker\\'s tip-top.\\nTHE WOLF\\nGood enough, let\\'s go back to the kitchen.\\nINT. KITCHEN – MORNING\\nJimmie hands The Wolf a cup of coffee.\\nTHE WOLF\\nThank you, Jimmie.}\\nHe takes a sip, then, pacing as he thinks, lays out for the three\\nmen the plan of action.\\nTHE WOLF\\nOkay first thing, you two.\\n(meaning Jules and Vincent)\\nTake the body, stick it in the trunk. Now\\nJimmie, this looks to be a pretty\\ndomesticated house. That would lead me to\\nbelieve that in the garage or under the\\nsink, you got a bunch of cleaners and\\ncleaners and shit like that, am I correct?\\nJIMMIE\\nYeah. Exactly. Under the sink.\\nTHE WOLF\\nGood. What I need you two fellas to do is\\ntake those cleaning products and clean the\\ninside of the car. And I\\'m talkin\\' fast,\\nfast, fast. You need to go in the\\nbackseat, scoop up all those little pieces\\nof brain and skull. Get it out of there.\\nWipe down the upholstery – now when it\\ncomes to upholstery, it don\\'t need to be\\nspic and span, you don\\'t need to eat off\\nin. Give it a good once over. What you\\nneed to take care of are the really messy\\nparts. The pools of blood that have\\ncollected, you gotta soak that shit up.\\nBut the windows are a different story.\\nThem you really clean. Get the Windex, do\\na good job. Now Jimmie, we need to raid\\nyour linen closet. I need blankets, I need\\ncomforters, I need quilts, I need\\nbedspreads. The thicker the better, the\\ndarker the better. No whites, can\\'t use\\n\\'em. We need to camouflage the interior of\\nthe car. We\\'re gonna line the front seat\\nand the backseat and the floor boards with\\nquilts and blankets. If a cop stops us and\\nstarts stickin\\' his big snout in the car,\\nthe subterfuge won\\'t last. But at a\\nglance, the car will appear to be normal.\\nJimmie – lead the way, boys – get to work.\\nThe Wolf and Jimmie turn, heading for the bedroom, leaving Vincent\\nand Jules standing in the kitchen.\\nVINCENT\\n(calling after him)\\nA \"please\" would be nice.\\nThe Wolf stops and turns around.\\nTHE WOLF\\nCome again?\\nVINCENT\\nI said a \"please\" would be nice.}\\nThe Wolf takes a step toward him.\\nTHE WOLF\\nSet is straight, Buster. I\\'m not here to\\nsay \"please.\"I\\'m here to tell you want to\\ndo. And if self-preservation is an\\ninstinct you possess, you better fuckin\\'\\ndo it and do it quick. I\\'m here to help.\\nIf my help\\'s not appreciated, lotsa luck\\ngentlemen.\\nJULES\\nIt ain\\'t that way, Mr. Wolf. Your help is\\ndefinitely appreciated.\\nVINCENT\\nI don\\'t mean any disrespect. I just don\\'t\\nlike people barkin\\' orders at me.\\nTHE WOLF\\nIf I\\'m curt with you, it\\'s because time is\\na factor. I think fast, I talk fast, and I\\nneed you guys to act fast if you want to\\nget out of this. So pretty please, with\\nsugar on top, clean the fuckin\\' car.\\nINT. JIMMIE\\'S BEDROOM – MORNING\\nJimmie\\'s gathering all the bedspreads, quilts and linen he has.\\nThe Wolf is on the phone.\\nTHE WOLF\\n(into phone)\\nIt\\'s a 1974 Chevy Nova.\\n(pause)\\nWhite.\\n(pause)\\nNothin\\', except for the mess inside.\\n(pause)\\nAbout twenty minutes.\\n(pause)\\nNobody who\\'ll be missed.\\n(pause)\\nYou\\'re a good man, Joe. See ya soon.\\n(he looks at Jimmie)\\nHow we comin\\', Jimmie?\\nJimmie comes over with a handful of linen.\\nJIMMIE\\nMr. Wolf, you gotta understand somethin\\' –\\nTHE WOLF\\n– Winston, Jimmie – please, Winston.}\\nJIMMIE\\nYou gotta understand something, Winston. I\\nwant to help you guys out and all, but\\nthat\\'s my best linen. It was a wedding\\npresent from my Uncle Conrad and Aunt\\nGinny, and they ain\\'t with us anymore –\\nTHE WOLF\\n– let me ask you a question, if you don\\'t\\nmind?\\nJIMMIE\\nSure.\\nTHE WOLF\\nWere you Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny\\nmillionaires?\\nJIMMIE\\nNo.\\nTHE WOLF\\nWell, your Uncle Marsellus is. And I\\'m\\npositive if Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny\\nwere millionaires, they would\\'ve furnished\\nyou with a whole bedroom set, which your\\nUncle Marsellus is more than happy to do.\\n(takes out a roll of bills)\\nI like oak myself, that\\'s what\\'s in my\\nbedroom. How \\'bout you Jimmie, you an oak\\nman?\\nJIMMIE\\nOak\\'s nice.\\nINT. GARAGE – MORNING\\nBoth Jules and Vincent are inside the car cleaning it up. Vincent\\nis in the front seat washing windows, while Jules is in the\\nbackseat, picking up little pieces of skull and gobs of brain.\\nBoth are twice as bloody as they were before.\\nJULES\\nI will never forgive your ass for this\\nshit. This is some fucked-up repugnant\\nshit!\\nVINCENT\\nDid you ever hear the philosophy that once\\na man admits he\\'s wrong, he\\'s immediately\\nforgiven for all wrong-doings?\\nJULES\\nMan, get outta my face with that shit! The\\nmotherfucker who said that never had to\\npick up itty-bitty pieces of skull with\\nhis fingers on account of your dumb ass.}\\nVINCENT\\nI got a threshold, Jules. I got a\\nthreshold for the abuse I\\'ll take. And\\nyou\\'re crossin\\' it. I\\'m a race car and you\\ngot me in the red. Redline 7000, that\\'s\\nwhere you are. Just know, it\\'s fuckin\\'\\ndangerous to be drivin\\' a race car when\\nit\\'s in the red. It could blow.\\nJULES\\nYou\\'re gettin\\' ready to blow? I\\'m a\\nmushroom-cloud-layin\\' motherfucker! Every\\ntime my fingers touch brain I\\'m \"SUPERFLY\\nT.N.T,\" I\\'m the \"GUNS OF NAVARONE.\" I\\'m\\nwhat Jimmie Walker usta talk about. In\\nfact, what the fuck am I doin\\' in the\\nback? You\\'re the motherfucker should be on\\nbrain detail. We\\'re tradin\\'. I\\'m washin\\'\\nwindows and you\\'re pickin\\' up this\\nnigger\\'s skull.\\nINT. CHEVY NOVA – MORNING\\nThe interior of the car has been cleaned and lined with bedspreads\\nand quilts. Believe it or not, what looked like a portable\\nslaughterhouse can actually pass for a non-descript vehicle.\\nThe Wolf circles the car examining it.\\nJules and Vincent stand aside, their clothes are literally a\\nbloody mess, but they do have a sense of pride in what a good job\\nthey\\'ve done.\\nTHE WOLF\\nFine job, gentlemen. We may get out of\\nthis yet.\\nJIMMIE\\nI can\\'t believe that\\'s the same car.\\nTHE WOLF\\nWell, let\\'s not start suckin\\' each other\\'s\\ndicks quite yet. Phase one is complete,\\nclean the car, which moves us right along\\nto phase two, clean you two.\\nEXT. JIMMIE\\'S BACKYARD – MORNING\\nJules and Vincent stand side by side in their black suits, covered\\nin blood, in Jimmie\\'s backyard. Jimmie holds a plastic Hefty trash\\nbag, while The Wolf holds a garden hose with one of those guns\\nnossles attached.\\nTHE WOLF\\nStrip.\\nVINCENT\\nAll the way?}\\nTHE WOLF\\nTo your bare ass.\\nAs they follow directions, The Wolf enjoys a smoke.\\nTHE WOLF\\nQuickly gentlemen, we got about fifteen\\nminutes before Jimmie\\'s better-half comes\\npulling into the driveway.\\nJULES\\nThis morning air is some chilly shit.\\nVINCENT\\nAre you sure this is absolutely necessary?\\nTHE WOLF\\nYou know what you two look like?\\nVINCENT\\nWhat?\\nTHE WOLF\\nLike a couple of guys who just blew off\\nsomebody\\'s head. Yes, strippin\\' off those\\nbloody rags is absolutely necessary. Toss\\nthe clothes in Jim\\'s garbage bag.\\nJULES\\nNow Jimmie, don\\'t do nothin\\' stupid like\\nputtin\\' that out in front of your house\\nfor Elmo the garbage man\\nto take away.\\nTHE WOLF\\nDon\\'t worry, we\\'re takin\\' it with us. Jim,\\nthe soap.\\nHe hands the now-naked men a bar of soap.\\nTHE WOLF\\nOkay gentlemen, you\\'re both been to County\\nbefore, I\\'m sure. Here it comes.\\nHe hits the trigger, water SHOOTS OUT, SMACKING both men.\\nJULES\\nGoddamn, that water\\'s fuckin\\' cold!\\nTHE WOLF\\nBetter you than me, gentlemen.\\nThe two men, trembling, scrub themselves.\\nTHE WOLF\\nDon\\'t be afraid of the soap, spread it\\naround.\\nThe Wolf stops the hose, tossing it on the ground.}\\nTHE WOLF\\nTowel \\'em.\\nJimmie tosses them each a towel, which they rub furiously across\\ntheir bodies.\\nTHE WOLF\\nYou\\'re dry enough, give \\'em their clothes.\\nFADE UP ON:\\nJULES ANDVINCENT\\nIn their tee-shirts and swim trunks. They look a million miles\\naway from the black-suited, bad-asses we first met.\\nTHE WOLF\\nPerfect. Perfect. We couldn\\'t\\'ve planned\\nthis better. You guys look like... what do\\nthey look like, Jimmie?\\nJIMMIE\\nDorks. They look like a couple of dorks.\\nThe Wolf and Jimmie laugh.\\nJULES\\nHa ha ha.

Don\\'t make me\\nbeg.\\nINT. JIMMIE\\'S GARAGE – MORNING\\nThe garbage bag is tossed in the car trunk on top of Marvin. The\\nWolf SLAMS is closed.}\\nTHE WOLF\\nGentlemen, let\\'s get our rules of the road\\nstraight. We\\'re going to a place called\\nMonster Joe\\'s Truck and Tow. Monster Joe\\nand his daughter Raquel are sympathetic to\\nout dilemma. The place is North Hollywood,\\nso a few twist and turns aside, we\\'ll be\\ngoin\\' up Hollywood Way. Now I\\'ll drive the\\ntainted car. Jules, you ride with me.\\nVincent, you follow in my Porsche. Now if\\nwe cross the path of any John Q. Laws,\\nnobody does a fuckin\\' thing \\'til I do\\nsomething.\\n(to Jules)\\nWhat did I say?\\nJULES\\nDon\\'t do shit unless –\\nTHE WOLF\\n– unless what?\\nJULES\\nUnless you do it first.\\nTHE WOLF\\nSpoken like a true prodigy.\\n(to Vincent)\\nHow \\'bout you, Lash Larue?

My gun just went off,\\nI dunno how.\\nTHE WOLF\\nFair enough.\\n(he throws Vince his car keys)\\nI drive real fuckin\\' fast, so keep up. If\\nI get my car back any different than I\\ngave it, Monster Joe\\'s gonna be disposing\\nof two bodies.\\nEXT.

Respect. You\\ncould lean a lot from those two fine\\nspecimens. Respect for one\\'s elders shows\\ncharacter.}\\nRAQUEL\\nI have character.\\nWINSTON\\nJust because you are a character doesn\\'t\\nmean you have character.\\nRAQUEL\\nOh you\\'re so funny, oh you\\'re so funny.\\nThe Porsche SHOOTS OFF down the road.\\nThe two men left alone look at each other.\\nJULES\\nWanna share a cab?\\nVINCENT\\nYou know I could go for some breakfast.\\nWhat to have breakfast with me?\\nJULES\\nSure.\\nINT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING\\nJules and Vincent sit at a booth. In front of Vincent is a big\\nstack of pancakes and sausages, which he eats with gusto. Jules,\\non the other hand, just has a cup of coffee and a muffin. He seems\\nfar away in thought. The Waitress pours a refill for both men,\\nVINCENT\\nThanks a bunch.\\n(to Jules, who\\'s nursing his coffee)\\nWant a sausage?\\nJULES\\nNaw, I don\\'t eat pork.\\nVINCENT\\nAre you Jewish?\\nJULES\\nI ain\\'t Jewish man, I just don\\'t dig on\\nswine.\\nVINCENT\\nWhy not?\\nJULES\\nThey\\'re filthy animals. I don\\'t eat filthy\\nanimals.\\nVINCENT\\nSausages taste good. Pork chops taste\\ngood.}\\nJULES\\nA sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie.\\nI\\'ll never know \\'cause even if it did, I\\nwouldn\\'t eat the filthy motherfucker. Pigs\\nsleep and root in shit. That\\'s a filthy\\nanimal. I don\\'t wanna eat nothin\\' that\\nain\\'t got enough sense to disregard its\\nown feces.\\nVINCENT\\nHow about dogs? Dogs eat their own feces.\\nJULES\\nI don\\'t eat dog either.\\nVINCENT\\nYes, but do you consider a dog to be a\\nfilthy animal?\\nJULES\\nI wouldn\\'t go so far as to call a dog\\nfilthy, but they\\'re definitely dirty. But\\na dog\\'s got personality. And  personality\\ngoes a long way.\\nVINCENT\\nSo by that rationale, if a pig had a\\nbetter personality, he\\'s cease to be a\\nfilthy animal?\\nJULES\\nWe\\'d have to be talkin\\' \\'bout one\\nmotherfuckin\\' charmin\\' pig. It\\'d have to\\nbe the Cary Grant of pigs.\\nThe two men laugh.\\nVINCENT\\nGood for you. Lighten up a little. You\\nbeen sittin\\' there all quiet.\\nJULES\\nI just been sittin\\' here thinkin\\'.\\nVINCENT\\n(mouthful of food)\\nAbout what?\\nJULES\\nThe miracle we witnessed.\\nVINCENT\\nThe miracle you witnessed. I witnessed a\\nfreak occurrence.\\nJULES\\nDo you know that a miracle is?\\nVINCENT\\nAn act of God.}\\nJULES\\nWhat\\'s an act of God?\\nVINCENT\\nI guess it\\'s when God makes the impossible\\npossible. And I\\'m sorry Jules, but I don\\'t\\nthink what happened this morning\\nqualifies.\\nJULES\\nDon\\'t you see, Vince, that shit don\\'t\\nmatter. You\\'re judging this thing the\\nwrong way. It\\'s not about what. It could\\nbe God stopped the bullets, he changed\\nCoke into Pepsi, he found my fuckin\\' car\\nkeys. You don\\'t judge shit like this based\\non merit. Whether or not what we\\nexperienced was an according-to-Hoyle\\nmiracle is insignificant. What is\\nsignificant is I felt God\\'s touch, God got\\ninvolved.\\nVINCENT\\nBut why?\\nJULES\\nThat\\'s what\\'s fuckin\\' wit\\' me! I don\\'t\\nknow why. But I can\\'t go back to sleep.\\nVINCENT\\nSo you\\'re serious, you\\'re really gonna\\nquit?\\nJULES\\nThe life, most definitely.\\nVincent takes a bite of food. Jules takes a sip of coffee In the\\nb.g., we see a PATRON call the Waitress.\\nPATRON\\nGarcon! Coffee!\\nWe recognize the patron to be Pumpkin from the first scene of\\nPumpkin and Honey Bunny.\\nVINCENT\\nSo if you\\'re quitting the life, what\\'ll\\nyou do?\\nJULES\\nThat\\'s what I\\'ve been sitting here\\ncontemplating. First, I\\'m gonna deliver\\nthis case to Marsellus. Then, basically,\\nI\\'m gonna walk the earth.\\nVINCENT\\nWhat do you mean, walk the earth?}\\nJULES\\nYou know, like Caine in \"KUNG FU.\" Just\\nwalk from town to town, meet people, get\\nin adventures.\\nVINCENT\\nHow long do you intend to walk the earth?\\nJULES\\nUntil God puts me where he want me to be.\\nVINCENT\\nWhat if he never does?\\nJULES\\nIf it takes forever, I\\'ll wait forever.\\nVINCENT\\nSo you decided to be a bum?\\nJULES\\nI\\'ll just be Jules, Vincent – no more, no\\nless.\\nVINCENT\\nNo Jules, you\\'re gonna be like those\\npieces of shit out there who beg for\\nchange. They walk around like a bunch of\\nfuckin\\' zombies, they sleep in garbage\\nbins, they eat what I throw away, and dogs\\npiss on \\'em. They got a word for \\'em,\\nthey\\'re called bums. And without a job,\\nresidence, or legal tender, that\\'s what\\nyou\\'re gonna be – a fuckin\\' bum!\\nJULES\\nLook my friend, this is just where me and\\nyou differ –\\nVINCENT\\n– what happened was peculiar – no doubt\\nabout it – but it wasn\\'t water into wine.\\nJULES\\nAll shapes and sizes, Vince.\\nVINCENT\\nStop fuckin\\' talkin\\' like that!\\nJULES\\nIf you find my answers frightening,\\nVincent, you should cease askin\\' scary\\nquestions.\\nVINCENT\\nI gotta take a shit. To be continued.}\\nVincent exitsfor the restroom.\\nJules, alone, takes a mouthful of muffin, then... Pumpkin and\\nHoney Bunny rise with guns raised.\\nPUMPKIN\\nEverybody be cool, this is a robbery!\\nHONEY BUNNY\\nAny of you fuckin\\' pricks move and I\\'ll\\nexecute every one of you motherfuckers!\\nGot that?!\\nJules looks up, not believing what he\\'s seeing. Under the table,\\nJules\\' hand goes to his .45 Automatic. He pulls it out, COCKING\\nIT.\\nPUMPKIN\\nCustomers stay seated, waitresses on the\\nfloor.\\nHONEY BUNNY\\nNow mean fuckin\\' now! Do it or die, do it\\nor fucking die!\\nLike lightning, Pumpkin moves over to the kitchen. While Honey\\nBunny SCREAMS out threats to the PATRONS, keeping them terrified.\\nPUMPKIN\\nYou Mexicans in the kitchen, get out here!\\nAsta luego!\\nThree COOKS and two BUSBOYS come out of the kitchen.\\nPUMPKIN\\nOn the floor or I\\'ll cook you ass,\\ncomprende?\\nThey comprende. The portly MANAGER speaks up.\\nMANAGER\\nI\\'m the manager here, there\\'s no problem,\\nno problem at all –\\nPumpkin head his way.\\nPUMPKIN\\nYou\\'re gonna give me a problem?\\nHe reaches him and sticks the barrel of his gun hard in the\\nManager\\'s neck.\\nPUMPKIN\\nWhat? You said you\\'re gonna give me a\\nproblem?\\nMANAGER\\nNo, I\\'m not. I\\'m not gonna give you any\\nproblem!}\\nPUMPKIN\\nI don\\'t know, Honey Bunny. He looks like\\nthe hero type to me!\\nHONEY BUNNY\\nDon\\'t take any chances. Execute him!\\nThe Patrons SCREAM. Jules watches all this silently, his hand\\ntightly gripping the .45 Automatic under the table.\\nMANAGER\\nPlease don\\'t! I\\'m not a hero. I\\'m just a\\ncoffee shop manager. Take anything you\\nwant.\\nPUMPKIN\\nTell everyone to cooperate and it\\'ll be\\nall over.\\nMANAGER\\nEverybody just be calm and cooperate with\\nthem and this will be all over soon!\\nPUMPKIN\\nWell done, now git your fuckin\\' ass on the\\nground.\\nINT. COFFEE SHOP BATHROOM – MORNING\\nVincent, on the toilet, oblivious to the pandemonium outside,\\nreads his \"MODESTY BLAISE\" book.\\nINT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING\\nCash register drawer opens. Pumpkin stuffs the money from the till\\nin his pocket. Then walks from behind the counter with a trash bag\\nin his hand.\\nPUMPKIN\\nOkay people, I\\'m going to go \\'round and\\ncollect your wallets. Don\\'t talk, just\\ntoss \\'em in the bag. We clear?\\nPumpkin goes around collecting wallets. Jules sits with his .45\\nready to spit under the table.\\nPumpkin sees Jules sitting in his booth, holding his wallet,\\nbriefcase next to him. Pumpkin crosses to him, his tone more\\nrespectful, him manner more on guard.\\nPUMPKIN\\nIn the bag.\\nJules DROPS his wallet in the bag. Using his gun as a pointer,\\nPumpkin points to the briefcase.\\nPUMPKIN\\nWhat\\'s in that?}\\nJULES\\nMy boss\\' dirty laundry.\\nPUMPKIN\\nYou boss makes you do his laundry?\\nJULES\\nWhen he wants it clean.\\nPUMPKIN\\nSounds like a shit job.\\nJULES\\nFunny, I\\'ve been thinkin\\' the same thing.\\nPUMPKIN\\nOpen it up.\\nJules\\' free hand lays palm flat on the briefcase.\\nJULES\\n\\'Fraid I can\\'t do that.\\nPumpkin is definitely surprised by his answer. He aims the gun\\nright in the middle of Jules\\' face and pulls back the hammer.\\nPUMPKIN\\nI didn\\'t hear you.\\nJULES\\nYes, you did.\\nThis exchange has been kind of quiet, not everybody heard it, but\\nHoney Bunny senses something\\'s wrong.\\nHONEY BUNNY\\nWhat\\'s goin\\' on?\\nPUMPKIN\\nLooks like we got a vigilante in our\\nmidst.\\nHONEY BUNNY\\nShoot \\'em in the face!\\nJULES\\nI don\\'t mean to shatter your ego, but this\\nain\\'t the first time I\\'ve had gun pointed\\nat me.\\nPUMPKIN\\nYou don\\'t open up that case, it\\'s gonna be\\nthe last.\\nMANAGER\\n(on the ground)\\nQuit causing problems, you\\'ll get us all\\nkilled! Give \\'em what you got and get \\'em\\nout of here.}\\nJULES\\nKeep your fuckin\\' mouth closed, fat man,\\nthis ain\\'t any of your goddamn business!\\nPUMPKIN\\nI\\'m countin\\' to three, and if your hand\\nain\\'t off that case, I\\'m gonna unload\\nright in your fuckin\\' face. Clear? One...\\nPUMPKIN\\n... two... three.\\nJULES\\nYou win.\\nJules raises his hand off the briefcase.\\nJULES\\nIt\\'s all yours, Ringo.\\nPUMPKIN\\nOpen it.\\nJules flips the locks and opens the case, revealing it to Pumpkin\\nbut not to us. The same light SHINES from the case. Pumpkin\\'s\\nexpression goes to amazement. Honey Bunny, across the room, can\\'t\\nsee shit.\\nHONEY BUNNY\\nWhat is it? What is it?\\nPUMPKIN\\n(softly)\\nIs that what I think it is?\\nJules nods his head: \"yes.\"\\nPUMPKIN\\nIt\\'s beautiful.\\nJules nods his head: \"yes.\"\\nHONEY BUNNY\\nGoddammit, what is it?\\nJules SLAMS the case closed, then sits back, as if offering the\\ncase to Pumpkin. Pumpkin, one big smile, bends over to pick up the\\ncase.\\nLike a rattlesnake, Jules\\' free hand GRABS the wrist of Pumpkin\\'s\\ngun hand, SLAMMING it on the table. His other hand comes from\\nunder the table and STICKS the barrel of his .45 hand under\\nPumpkin\\'s chin.\\nHoney Bunny freaks out, waving his gun in Jules\\' direction.}\\nHONEY BUNNY\\nLet him go! Let him go! I\\'ll blow your\\nfuckin\\' head off! I\\'ll kill ya! I\\'ll kill\\nya! You\\'re gonna die, you\\'re gonna fuckin\\'\\ndie bad!\\nJULES\\n(to Pumpkin)\\nTell that bitch to be cool! Say, bitch be\\ncool! Say, bitch be cool!\\nPUMPKIN\\nChill out, honey!\\nHONEY BUNNY\\nLet him go!\\nJULES\\n(softly)\\nTell her it\\'s gonna be okay.\\nPUMPKIN\\nI\\'m gonna be okay.\\nJULES\\nPromise her.\\nPUMPKIN\\nI promise.\\nJULES\\nTell her to chill.\\nPUMPKIN\\nJust chill out.\\nJULES\\nWhat\\'s her name?\\nPUMPKIN\\nYolanda.\\nWhenever Jules talks to Yolanda, he never looks at her, only at\\nPumpkin.\\nJULES\\n(to Yolanda)\\nSo, we cool Yolanda? We ain\\'t gonna do\\nanything stupid, are we?\\nYOLANDA\\n(crying)\\nDon\\'t you hurt him.\\nJULES\\nNobody\\'s gonna hurt anybody. We\\'re gonna\\nbe like three Fonzies. And what\\' Fonzie\\nlike?\\nNo answer.}\\nJULES\\nC\\'mon Yolanda, what\\'s Fonzie like?\\nYOLANDA\\n(through tears, unsure)\\nHe\\'s cool?\\nJULES\\nCorrect-amundo! And that\\'s what we\\'re\\ngonna be, we\\'re gonna be cool.\\n(to Pumpkin)\\nNow Ringo, I\\'m gonna count to three and I\\nwant you to let go your gun and lay your\\npalms flat on the table. But when you do\\nit, do it cool. Ready?\\nPumpkin looks at him.\\nJULES\\nOne... two... three.\\nPumpkin lets go of his gun and places both hands on the table.\\nYolanda can\\'t stand it anymore.\\nYOLANDA\\nOkay, now let him go!\\nJULES\\nYolanda, I thought you were gonna be cool.\\nWhen you yell at me, it makes me nervous.\\nWhen I get nervous, I get scared. And when\\nmotherfuckers get scared, that\\'s when\\nmotherfuckers get accidentally shot.\\nYOLANDA\\n(more conversational)\\nJust know: you hurt him, you die.\\nJULES\\nThat seems to be the situation. Now I\\ndon\\'t want that and you don\\'t want that\\nand Ringo here don\\'t want that. So let\\'s\\nsee what we can do.\\n(to Ringo)\\nNow this is the situation. Normally both\\nof your asses would be dead as fuckin\\'\\nfried chicken. But you  appened to pull\\nthis shit while I\\'m in a transitional\\nperiod. I don\\'t wanna kill ya, I want to\\nhelp ya. But I\\'m afraid I can\\'t give you\\nthe case. It don\\'t belong to me. Besides,\\nI went through too much shit this morning\\non account of this case to just hand it\\nover to your ass.\\nVINCENT (O.S.)\\nWhat the fuck\\'s goin\\' on here?\\nYolanda WHIPS her gun toward the stranger.}\\nVincent, by the bathroom, has his gun out, dead-aimed at Yolanda.\\nJULES\\nIt\\'s cool, Vincent! It\\'s cool! Don\\'t do a\\ngoddamn thing. Yolanda, it\\'s cool baby,\\nnothin\\'s changed. We\\'re still just\\ntalkin\\'.\\n(to Pumpkin)\\nTell her we\\'re still cool.\\nPUMPKIN\\nIt\\'s cool, Honey Bunny, we\\'re still cool.\\nVINCENT\\n(gun raised)\\nWhat the hell\\'s goin\\' on, Jules?\\nJULES\\nNothin\\' I can\\'t handle. I want you to just\\nhang back and don\\'t do shit unless it\\'s\\nabsolutely necessary.\\nVINCENT\\nCheck.\\nJULES\\nYolanda, how we doin, baby?\\nYOLANDA\\nI gotta go pee! I want to go home.\\nJULES\\nJust hang in there, baby, you\\'re doing\\'\\ngreat,Ringo\\'s proud of you and so am I.\\nIt\\'s almost over.\\n(to Pumpkin)\\nNow I want you to go in that bag and find\\nmy wallet.\\nPUMPKIN\\nWhich one is it?\\nJULES\\nIt\\'s the one that says Bad Motherfucker on\\nit.\\nPumpkin looks in the bag and – sure enough – there\\'s a wallet with\\n\"Bad Motherfucker\" embroidered on it.\\nJULES\\nThat\\'s my bad motherfucker. Now open it up\\nand take out the cash. How much is there?\\nPUMPKIN\\nAbout fifteen hundred dollars.}\\nJULES\\nPut it in your pocket, it\\'s yours. Now\\nwith the rest of them wallets and the\\nregister, that makes this a pretty\\nsuccessful little score.\\nVINCENT\\nJules, if you give this nimrod fifteen\\nhundred buck, I\\'m gonna shoot \\'em on\\ngeneral principle.\\nJULES\\nYou ain\\'t gonna do a goddamn thing, now\\nhang back and shut the fuck up. Besides, I\\nain\\'t givin\\' it to him. I\\'m buyin\\'\\nsomethin\\' for my money. Wanna know what\\nI\\'m buyin\\' Ringo?\\nPUMPKIN\\nWhat?\\nJULES\\nYour life. I\\'m givin\\' you that money so I\\ndon\\'t hafta kill your ass. You read the\\nBible?\\nPUMPKIN\\nNot regularly.\\nJULES\\nThere\\'s a passage I got memorized. Ezekiel\\n25:17. \"The path of the righteous man is\\nbeset on all sides by the inequities of\\nthe selfish and the tyranny of evil men.\\nBlessed is he who, in the name of charity\\nand good will, shepherds the weak through\\nthe valley of the darkness. For he is\\ntruly his brother\\'s keeper and the finder\\nof lost children. And I will strike down\\nupon thee with great vengeance and furious\\nanger those who attempt to poison and\\ndestroy my brothers. And you will know I\\nam the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon\\nyou.\"I been sayin\\' that shit for years.\\nAnd if you ever heard it, it meant your\\nass. I never really questioned what it\\nmeant. I thought it was just a cold-\\nblooded thing to say to a motherfucker\\n\\'fore you popped a cap in his ass. But I\\nsaw some shit this mornin\\' made me think\\ntwice. Now I\\'m thinkin\\', it could mean\\nyou\\'re the evil man. And I\\'m the righteous\\nman. And Mr. .45 here, he\\'s the shepherd\\nprotecting my righteous ass in the valley\\nof darkness. Or is could by you\\'re the\\nrighteous man and I\\'m the shepherd and\\nit\\'s the world that\\'s evil and selfish.\\n(MORE)}\\nJULES (CONT\\'D)\\nI\\'d like that. But that shit ain\\'t the\\ntruth. The truth is you\\'re the weak. And\\nI\\'m the tyranny of evil men. But I\\'m\\ntryin\\'. I\\'m tryin\\' real hard to be a\\nshepherd.\\nJules lowers his gun, lying it on the table.\\nPumpkin looks at him, to the money in his hand, then to Yolanda.\\nShe looks back.\\nGrabbing the trash bag full of wallets, the two RUN out the door.\\nJules, who was never risen from his seat the whole time, takes a\\nsip of coffee.\\nJULES\\n(to himself)\\nIt\\'s cold.\\nHe pushes it aside.\\nVincent appears next to Jules.\\nVINCENT\\nI think we oughta leave now.\\nJULES\\nThat\\'s probably a good idea.\\nVincent throws some money on the table and Jules grabs the\\nbriefcase.\\nThen, to the amazement of the Patrons, the Waitresses, the Cooks,\\nthe Bus Boys, and the Manager, these two bad-ass dudes – wearing\\nUC Santa Cruz and \"I\\'m with Stupid\" tee-shirts, swim trunks,\\nthongs and packing .45 Automatics – walk out of the coffee shop\\ntogether without saying a word.\\nFADE OUT\\nTHE END}\\n', metadata={'source': 'pulp-fiction-1994 (1).txt'})]"
