# chat_with_documents
Notebooks &amp; other stuff to chat with your documents. In progress. Working towards a tutorial(s).

This will be a set of notebooks accompanied by tutorials, so you can build the knowledge required 

I now think of the following notebooks with explanations.

1. OpenAI API - to use ChatGPT and GPT-3.5 or other large language models (LLM's) 
2. LangChain - to interact with documents and OpenAI (splitting text in chunks etc)
3. Vector databases - Like Pinecone and Weaviate
4. User Interface - streamlit or Panel or...
5. Alternatives to OpenAI like LLaMa or Vicu√±a or ...
6. Chat with your data 

To do: multiple .pdf's or txt or other file formats
